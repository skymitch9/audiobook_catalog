They discovered their old foes weren&#x27;t gone, as they&#x27;d thought. Not only were they not gone, but they were also stronger than before. Morgan would have to deal with this threat while at the same time trying to restore some sort of quality of life to his community.

 But this wasn&#x27;t going to be easy. With the bombing at the market and the wounding of his daughter, Taylor, it became all too clear to Morgan that he was once again in a fight for the lives of those who mattered most to him. Taylor was injured and would need care for some time. It wouldn&#x27;t be easy. Added to that was the realization that he would have to deal with second-guessing himself. Was it his fault that she was now hurt?

 In Avenging Home, we see how this long-running battle between Morgan&#x27;s people and their number one nemesis plays out. While Morgan thinks this is the biggest threat they face, there are things on the horizon he cannot yet see that are going to dwarf these problems.

 Morgan has lived in a vacuum. He&#x27;s had little information about the outside world. While he&#x27;s used radios to listen to what he can, there&#x27;s been precious little real information. But now he&#x27;s found what he believes to be a reliable source and knows when and where to listen. But is it valid? Or is it simply propaganda? News and information can be powerful tools, but they must always be taken in context to make an educated decision. And the challenge is that there&#x27;s only one source. When you have to make decisions that mean the difference between life and death, the process becomes even more critical.

 So we&#x27;ll follow Morgan and his tightly knit group as they are once again in the fight. Will they finally defeat the federal thugs in their backyard? And, more importantly, what will be the cost?"><img class="cover" src="covers/A.

The Japanese fleet off the coast of California was wiped out. An even that Morgan and friends and family only knew about because of the radio broadcasts from the Radio Free Redoubt. So far removed from them it barely warranted notice. That is until the Chinese retaliated by launching a nuclear counter-strike against Mac Dill Air Force base. This, did warrant their attention and had the potential to profoundly impact their lives.

 As bad as the fear of nuclear fallout was, it wasn&#x27;t the only threat still haunting northern Lake county. With proof the Russians had pathfinder units on the ground, at a minimum, in the state and discovery of Cuban forces cooperating with them, something had to be done. After encountering armored units and realizing they were ill equipped to deal with the threat, the old man called for help. The call was answered, but would require a near impossible trip by truck to Eglin Air Force base. America was certainly on the ropes, but she wasn&#x27;t down yet.

 All Morgan wants to do is protect his family and friends. To restore a normal sense of life. To see to it Mel and his girls are safe and protected. He doesn&#x27;t want to get involved in these military actions. He&#x27;s more focused on trying to restore power to town. But his desires are, to use a military term, overtaken by circumstances, and, once again, Morgan and his friends are compelled to get involved. And this time, it will cost them."><img class="cover" src="covers/A.

But with the help of his close-knit group he prevailed. Life is settling into a familiar routine. And with the help of the US Army, they are starting to rebuild their community. But just when Morgan thinks things are assuming some kind of normal, another surprise lands in his lap. He&#x27;s made sheriff.

 Harkening back to a time when law enforcement was a local face in the community, Morgan is forced to step up and be that face, much to his chagrin. With the help of Thad, Danny, and the rest of the crew, he accepts the challenge and tries to make a positive impact. But he&#x27;s in for yet another surprise. New foes will arise, and old ones will return to conspire to destroy his efforts.

 Morgan&#x27;s group will suffer loss, injury, and constant assault. His new position has made him a target as well as those he loves. The peace and tranquility that the group has fought so hard for will continue to elude them. The fight, as Morgan soon learns, is just beginning."><img class="cover" src="covers/A.

There was the promise of power once again. The plant was being repaired, and it looked as though it may actually run. While it meant lots of hard, sweaty work, the reward was worth the investment. The farm was growing strong, and community involvement was good. People were finally coming to terms with the fact that they needed to work together. So far Mother Nature had been on their side. But that, too, was about to change.

 There was no shortage of problems. There were those in town with their own plans. And those plans did not include Sheriff Morgan Carter. For the most part, Morgan ignored the issue, thinking it would simply go away. But that was not to be. He would have to face it head on, and it just may cost him his life. As serious as the issues in town were, there were other much larger problems brewing. These were beyond his control. They were beyond the control of the entire community, even if they were banded together. And Morgan would not be able to simply ignore them either. There were forces converging on Central Florida that would bring back the uncertainty that only recently appeared to be vanquished. Only this time it would be far worse than a rogue band of federal agents. War was coming, and with it death. It would test them all."><img class="cover" src="covers/A.

 &quot;Astounding. Thrilling. Amazing.&quot;  (Gillian Flynn)

 &quot;Unputdownable.&quot;  (Stephen King)

 &quot;A dark, twisty confection.&quot;  (Ruth Ware)

 &quot;Absolutely gripping.&quot;  (Louise Penny)

 For listeners of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade&#x27;s most anticipated debuts, to be published in 36 languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: A twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house.

 It isn&#x27;t paranoia if it&#x27;s really happening....

 Anna Fox lives alone - a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times...and spying on her neighbors.

 Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn&#x27;t, her world begins to crumble. And its shocking secrets are laid bare.

 What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one - and nothing - is what it seems.

 Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.

 Bonus: Includes an interview with author A. J. Finn."><img class="cover" src="covers/A. J.

 Welcome my friends!

 Welcome...to “The Land&quot;!

 The battle of the dead was won, but at a great cost. Sion, leader of the Mist Village, was left with only pain and regret as Richter was claimed by the abyss.

 What no one but the abandoned chaos seed knows is that he narrowly avoided the curse of the lich Singh, a curse that still hangs above his head. Now, surrounded by miles of darkness and tons of crushing rock, Richter has to find his way back into the light.

 The only problem is that this monster of a man is being pursued by monsters, a demon, and his own foolish choices. Faced with all the dangers of the deep dark, what will Richter say when the buried horrors of The Land come a calling and asked if he&#x27;s paid his dues?

 Well he&#x27;ll look right back, stare that horror in the eye, and say, &quot;Yes sir, the check is in the mail!&quot;

 Welcome back my friends! Welcome back...to The Land!

 Number one in epic fantasy, cyberpunk, and video game fantasy

 In The Land: Predators, the Mist Village has harnessed its power. With core buildings, Professional fighters, and now their own Dungeon, the settlement is primed to grow into a kingdom of true power and magic. The path to power has not been without risk, however. The Mist Village has been noticed.

 Evil nobles from the Kingdom of Law, bloodthirsty goblins from the Serrated Mountains, an undead lord with a penchant for human sacrifice, and fanatical kobolds from the Depths all plot the village&#x27;s destruction. The predators are circling. Richter&#x27;s people are horribly outnumbered by foes whose own power has been entrenched for thousands of years.

 Richter and Sion need to be stronger than ever before. Luckily, they are. New skills have been learned, stronger enchantments have been wrought, and the hundreds of villagers have answered the call to adventure. The Companions do not stand alone. While many eyes have turned toward the mists, wanting to take the treasures within, the Mist Village stares back with a simple message.

 Welcome to the Centennial.

 Every 100 years, the island of Lightlark appears to host the Centennial, a deadly game that only the rulers of six realms are invited to play. The invitation is a summons—a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm’s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.

 Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling—a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.

 To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray...even as love complicates everything.

 Filled with secrets, deception, romance, and twists worthy of the darkest thrillers, Lightlark is a must-hear for fans of legendary fantasy writers Marie Lu, Marissa Meyer, and Leigh Bardugo."><img class="cover" src="covers/Alex Aster/Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1</td><td>The Lightlark Saga</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Alex Aster</td><td>Suzy Jackson</td><td>2022-08-23</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thrillers &amp; Suspense</td><td>12:57</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Alex Michaelides/The Silent Patient.jpg" data-title="The Silent Patient" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Alex Michaelides" data-narrator="Jack Hawkins, Louise Brealey" data-year="2019-02-05" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Psychological" data-duration="8:33" data-desc="&quot;The perfect binge listen.&quot;—Yahoo Lifestyle

 Instant #1 New York Times bestseller.

 The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.

 Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.

 Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.

 Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....

 When the Children&#x27;s League disbands, Ruby rises up as a leader and forms an unlikely allegiance with Liam&#x27;s brother, Cole, who has a volatile secret of his own.

 When Ruby is entrusted with an explosive secret, she must embark on her most dangerous mission yet: leaving the Children’s League behind. Crucial information about the disease that killed most of America’s children - and turned Ruby and the others who lived into feared and hated outcasts - has survived every attempt to destroy it. But the truth is saved in only one place: a flash drive in the hands of Liam Stewart, the boy Ruby once believed was her future - and who now wouldn’t recognize her.

When her two talents collide during a stressful performance, Etta is drawn back hundreds of years through time.

 Etta wakes, confused and terrified, in 1776, in the midst a fierce sea battle. Nicholas Carter, the handsome young prize master of a privateering ship, has been hired to retrieve Etta and deliver her unharmed to the Ironwoods, a powerful family in the Colonies - the very same one that orchestrated her jump back, and one Nicholas himself has ties to. But discovering she can time travel is nothing compared to the shock of discovering the true reason the Ironwoods have ensnared her in their web.

 Another traveler has stolen an object of untold value from them, and, if Etta can find it, they will return her to her own time. Out of options, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the mysterious traveler. But as they draw closer to each other and the end of their search, the true nature of the object, and the dangerous game the Ironwoods are playing, comes to light - threatening to separate her not only from Nicholas, but her path home...forever."><img class="cover" src="covers/Alexandra Bracken/Passenger - Passenger, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Passenger - Passenger, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Passenger - Passenger, Book 1</td><td>Passenger (Bracken)</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Alexandra Bracken</td><td>Saskia Maarleveld</td><td>2016-01-05</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>13:28</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Alexandra Bracken/The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1.jpg" data-title="The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1" data-series="Darkest Minds" data-index="1" data-author="Alexandra Bracken" data-narrator="Amy Mcfadden" data-year="2012-12-30" data-genre="Teen &amp; Young Adult:Romance:Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="13:56" data-desc="Book one in the blockbuster Darkest Minds series—now with cover art from the major motion picture!

 When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government &quot;rehabilitation camp.&quot; She might have survived the mysterious disease that killed most of America&#x27;s children, but she and the others emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.

 Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.

 But when the truth about Ruby&#x27;s abilities—the truth she&#x27;s hidden from everyone, even the camp authorities—comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. On the run, she joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp: Zu, a young girl haunted by her past; Chubs, a standoffish brainiac; and Liam, their fearless leader, who is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can&#x27;t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.

 While they journey to find the one safe haven left for kids like them—East River—they must evade their determined pursuers, including an organization that will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. But as they get closer to grasping the things they&#x27;ve dreamed of, Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living."><img class="cover" src="covers/Alexandra Bracken/The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1</td><td>Darkest Minds</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Alexandra Bracken</td><td>Amy Mcfadden</td><td>2012-12-30</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Romance:Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy</td><td>13:56</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Alexandra Silber/After Anatevka- Live.jpg" data-title="After Anatevka: Live" data-series="After Anatevka" data-index="Live" data-author="Alexandra Silber" data-narrator="Ellie Fishman, Kerstin Anderson, Sheldon Harnick, Ben Moss, Matthew Scott, Alexandra Silber, Samantha Massell" data-year="2018-10-04" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Drama &amp; Plays" data-duration="1:24" data-desc="A special live performance to satisfy Fiddler on the Roof fans who have long wondered what became of Tevye’s beloved family. Experience an enthralling performance featuring a cast of rising Broadway stars who join actress and author Alexandra Silber in celebrating the Audible release of After Anatevka, the sweeping historical novel she wrote about Tevye’s second-eldest daughter, Hodel. Silber’s fascination with Hodel began when she played her in a production of Fiddler in London’s West End. Actors often write a backstory for the characters they play so they can fully imagine and embody them onstage. But Silber was more interested in Hodel’s fate than her history. “I had never played a character who felt so much like me,” she says. “I felt responsible for what happened to her after she boards the train to Siberia to join her revolutionary fiancé Perchik.”

 Originally commissioned by Symphony Space, a form of this concert was produced in March 2017. After Anatevka Live brings to life dramatic excerpts from Silber’s novel with five original songs by contemporary composer and lyricist teams, plus two much-loved songs from Fiddler and one gem that was cut from the final song book. Directed by Carolyn Cantor with musical direction by Ben Moss and an introduction from Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning Fiddler lyricist Sheldon Harnick, this is a charming and magical event for any lover of musical theater.

 Maya Killgore is twenty-three and still in the process of figuring out her life.

 Conor Harkness is thirty-eight, and Maya cannot stop thinking about him.

 It’s such a cliché, it almost makes her heart implode: older man and younger woman; successful biotech guy and struggling grad student; brother’s best friend and the girl he never even knew existed. As Conor loves to remind her, the power dynamic is too imbalanced. Any relationship between them would be problematic in too many ways to count, and Maya should just get over him. After all, he has made it clear that he wants her gone from his life.

 But not everything is as it seems—and clichés sometimes become plot twists.

 When Maya’s brother decides to get married in Taormina, she and Conor end up stuck together in a romantic Sicilian villa for over a week. There, on the beautiful Ionian coast, between ancient ruins, delicious foods, and natural caves, Maya realizes that Conor might be hiding something from her. And as the destination wedding begins to erupt out of control, she decides that a summer fling might be just what she needs—even if it’s a problematic one."><img class="cover" src="covers/Ali Hazelwood/Problematic Summer Romance.jpg" alt="Cover of Problematic Summer Romance" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Problematic Summer Romance</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Ali Hazelwood</td><td>Elizabeth Lamont, Eric Nolan</td><td>2025-05-27</td><td>Romance:Contemporary</td><td>11:34</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Ali Hazelwood/Two Can Play.jpg" data-title="Two Can Play" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Ali Hazelwood" data-narrator="Kelsey Navarro Foster" data-year="2024-10-01" data-genre="Romance:Contemporary" data-duration="4:24" data-desc="An enemies-to-lovers spicy romance set in the world of video gaming from the bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis—available only in audio!

 My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:

  I&#x27;m in a coma. My husband doesn&#x27;t love me anymore. Sometimes I lie.   Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can&#x27;t move. She can&#x27;t speak. She can&#x27;t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn&#x27;t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it.

 Lan spends her nights as a songgirl in Haak’gong, a city transformed by the Elantian colonizers. Her days are consumed by the search for knowledge about the strange mark—an untranslatable Hin character—burned into her arm by her mother in her last act before she died.

 Zen is a practitioner—one of the fabled magicians of the Last Kingdom. He’s never seen anything like Lan’s mark, but he knows that if there are answers, they lie deep in the pine forests and misty mountains of the Last Kingdom, with an order of practitioning masters planning to overthrow the Elantian regime.

 Yet, both Lan and Zen are hiding secrets—secrets that are buried deep within them. Secrets that even they have still to unearth. Both hold the power to liberate their land, if they don&#x27;t destroy it first.

 Now the battle for the Last Kingdom begins.

 Jazz Bashara is a criminal. Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you&#x27;re not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you&#x27;ve got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent.

 Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she&#x27;s stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.

 A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the number-one New York Times best-selling author of The Martian.

 Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the Earth itself will perish.

 Except that right now, he doesn&#x27;t know that. He can&#x27;t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.

 All he knows is that he&#x27;s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he&#x27;s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

 His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that&#x27;s been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it&#x27;s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

 And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.

 Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian - while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.

 Based on the thrilling real-life story of socialite spy Nancy Wake, comes the newest feat of historical fiction from the New York Times best-selling author of I Was Anastasia, featuring the astonishing woman who killed a Nazi with her bare hands and went on to become one of the most decorated women in WWII.

 Told in interweaving timelines organized around the four code names Nancy used during the war, Code Name Hélène is a spellbinding and moving story of enduring love, remarkable sacrifice, and unfaltering resolve that chronicles the true exploits of a woman who deserves to be a household name.

 It is 1936, and Nancy Wake is an intrepid Australian expat living in Paris who has bluffed her way into a reporting job for Hearst newspaper when she meets the wealthy French industrialist Henri Fiocca. No sooner does Henri sweep Nancy off her feet and convince her to become Mrs. Fiocca than the Germans invade France and she takes yet another name: a code name.

 As Lucienne Carlier, Nancy smuggles people and documents across the border. Her success and her remarkable ability to evade capture earns her the nickname &quot;The White Mouse&quot; from the Gestapo. With a five million-franc bounty on her head, Nancy is forced to escape France and leave Henri behind. When she enters training with the Special Operations Executives in Britain, her new comrades are instructed to call her Hélène. And finally, with mission in hand, Nancy is airdropped back into France as the deadly Madam Andrée, where she claims her place as one of the most powerful leaders in the French Resistance, armed with her ferocious wit, her signature red lipstick, and the ability to summon weapons straight from the Allied Forces.

 But no one can protect Nancy if the enemy finds out these four women are one and the same, and the closer to liberation France gets, the more exposed she - and the people she loves - become."><img class="cover" src="covers/Ariel Lawhon/Code Name Hélène - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Code Name Hélène - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Code Name Hélène - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Ariel Lawhon</td><td>Barrie Kreinik, Peter Ganim</td><td>2020-03-31</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Biographical Fiction</td><td>17:17</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Arthur Conan Doyle/Sherlock Holmes- The Definitive Collection.jpg" data-title="Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection" data-series="Sherlock Holmes" data-index="1-6" data-author="Arthur Conan Doyle, Stephen Fry - Introductions" data-narrator="Stephen Fry" data-year="2017-02-27" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Mystery:Traditional Detectives" data-duration="71:57" data-desc="&quot;Fry&#x27;s Holmes is crisp and high-handed, his Watson enthusiastic and bemused, and the rest of the narration colorful without being mannered.

 A New York Public Library Best Book of 2023

 &quot;A gorgeous love story from one of the finest romance writers out there.&quot;—Carley Fortune, New York Times bestselling author of Every Summer After

 Sometimes, the worst day of your life happens, and you have to figure out how to live after it.

 So Clementine forms a plan to keep her heart safe: work hard, find someone decent to love, and try to remember to chase the moon. The last one is silly and obviously metaphorical, but her aunt always told her that you needed at least one big dream to keep going. And for the last year, that plan has gone off without a hitch. Mostly. The love part is hard because she doesn’t want to get too close to anyone—she isn’t sure her heart can take it.

 And then she finds a strange man standing in the kitchen of her late aunt’s apartment. A man with kind eyes and a Southern drawl and a taste for lemon pies. The kind of man that, before it all, she would’ve fallen head-over-heels for. And she might again.

 Except, he exists in the past. Seven years ago, to be exact. And she, quite literally, lives seven years in his future.

 Her aunt always said the apartment was a pinch in time, a place where moments blended together like watercolors. And Clementine knows that if she lets her heart fall, she’ll be doomed.

 After all, love is never a matter of time—but a matter of timing."><img class="cover" src="covers/Ashley Poston/The Seven Year Slip.jpg" alt="Cover of The Seven Year Slip" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Seven Year Slip</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Ashley Poston</td><td>Brittany Pressley</td><td>2023-06-27</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Magical Realism</td><td>9:43</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Atlas Kane/Towers of Acalia- The Reincarnated Core, Volume 1.jpg" data-title="Towers of Acalia: The Reincarnated Core, Volume 1" data-series="Towers of Acalia" data-index="1" data-author="Atlas Kane" data-narrator="Daniel Wisniewski, Rebecca Woods" data-year="2021-08-31" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic" data-duration="12:03" data-desc="My name&#x27;s Rin, and I&#x27;ve been reborn as a cultivator with a broken core.

 In A Psalm for the Wild-Built, Hugo Award-winner Becky Chambers&#x27;s delightful new Monk and Robot series gives us hope for the future.

 It&#x27;s been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness, never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend.

 One day, the life of a tea monk is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of &quot;what do people need?&quot; is answered.

 But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how.

 They&#x27;re going to need to ask it a lot.

 Becky Chambers&#x27;s new series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?

 Everyone in my family has killed someone. Some of us, the high achievers, have killed more than once. I’m not trying to be dramatic, but it is the truth. Some of us are good, others are bad, and some just unfortunate.

 I’m Ernest Cunningham. Call me Ern or Ernie. I wish I’d killed whoever decided our family reunion should be at a ski resort, but it’s a little more complicated than that.

 Have I killed someone? Yes. I have.

 A “mind-blowing” (Entertainment Weekly) speculative thriller about an ordinary man who awakens in a world inexplicably different from the reality he thought he knew—from the author of Upgrade, Recursion, and the Wayward Pines trilogy

 “Are you happy with your life?”

 Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the kidnapper knocks him unconscious.

 Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits.

 Before a man he’s never met smiles down at him and says, “Welcome back, my friend.”

 In this world he’s woken up to, Jason’s life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college professor but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.

 Is it this life or the other that’s the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how will Jason make it back to the family he loves?

 From the bestselling author Blake Crouch, Dark Matter is a mind-bending thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we’ll go to claim the lives we dream of."><img class="cover" src="covers/Blake Crouch/Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel</td><td>Movie Tie</td><td data-sort="">In</td><td>Blake Crouch</td><td>Jon Lindstrom</td><td>2016-07-26</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Suspense</td><td>10:08</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Bob Newhart/Hi Bob!.jpg" data-title="Hi Bob!" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Bob Newhart" data-narrator="Will Ferrell, Jimmy Kimmel, Lisa Kudrow, Judd Apatow, Conan O&#x27;brien, Sarah Silverman, Marc Maron" data-year="2018-07-18" data-genre="Arts &amp; Entertainment:Audio Performances &amp; Dramatizations" data-duration="3:35" data-desc="You heard “Hi Bob!” 256 times as characters greeted him on The Bob Newhart Show.

Supermarket is like Naked Lunch meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest - if they met at Fight Club.” (Ernest Cline, number one New York Times best-selling author of Ready Player One)

 Flynn is stuck - depressed, recently dumped, and living at his mom’s house. The supermarket was supposed to change all that. An ordinary job and a steady check. Work isn’t work when it’s saving you from yourself. But things aren’t quite as they seem in these aisles. Arriving to work one day to a crime scene, Flynn’s world collapses as the secrets of his tortured mind are revealed. And Flynn doesn’t want to go looking for answers at the supermarket.

 Led by philosopher and metaphysician Professor Van Helsing - Dracula&#x27;s most indomitable adversary - Harker, Mina, and a band of allies unite, determined to confront and destroy the Count before he can escape.

 Bram Stoker ingeniously modernized gothic folklore by moving his vampire from traditional castle ruins to modern England. With Dracula, which has been interpreted and dissected by scholars for generations, Stoker changed the vampire novel forever.

 Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus, and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell - the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home.

 Now, the Superiority - the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life - has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator.

 Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy.

 The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return.

 To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3</td><td>The Skyward Series</td><td data-sort="3.0">3</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Suzy Jackson</td><td>2021-11-23</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>13:15</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive.jpg" data-title="Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive" data-series="The Stormlight Archive" data-index="3.5" data-author="Brandon Sanderson" data-narrator="Kate Reading, Michael Kramer" data-year="2022-08-16" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Sea Adventures" data-duration="7:05" data-desc="From Brandon Sanderson—author of the #1 New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive and its fourth massive installment, Rhythm of War—comes a new hefty novella, Dawnshard.

 When a ghost ship is discovered, its crew presumed dead after trying to reach the storm-shrouded island Akina, Navani Kholin must send an expedition to make sure the island hasn&#x27;t fallen into enemy hands. Knights Radiant who fly too near find their Stormlight suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.

 Shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a Stormlight-ingesting winged larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn&#x27;s pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri’s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani&#x27;s quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive.jpg" alt="Cover of Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive</td><td>The Stormlight Archive</td><td data-sort="3.5">3.5</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Kate Reading, Michael Kramer</td><td>2022-08-16</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Sea Adventures</td><td>7:05</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Defiant.jpg" data-title="Defiant" data-series="The Skyward Series" data-index="4" data-author="Brandon Sanderson" data-narrator="Suzy Jackson" data-year="2023-11-21" data-genre="Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure" data-duration="13:49" data-desc="From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson comes the final book in an epic series about a girl who will travel beyond the stars to save the world she loves from destruction.

 Spensa made it out of the Nowhere, but what she saw in the space between the stars has changed her forever. She came face to face with the Delvers, and finally got answers to the questions she’s had about her own strange Cytonic gifts.

 The Superiority didn’t stop fighting for galactic dominance while she was gone, though. Spensa’s team, Skyward Flight, was able to hold Winzik off, and even collect allies to help with the cause, but it’s only a matter of time until humanity—and the rest of the galaxy—falls.

 Defeating them will require all the knowledge Spensa gathered while in the Nowhere. But being Cytonic is more complicated than she ever could have imagined. Now, Spensa must ask herself: how far is she willing to go for victory, if it means losing herself—and her friends—in the process?

 The final book in the Skyward series will free humanity, or see it fall forever.

 Three years ago, Lift asked a goddess to stop her from growing older - a wish she believed was granted. Now, in Edgedancer, the barely teenage nascent Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness, court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can&#x27;t help heading to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers.

 This new edition begins with a preface by author Dan Wells, the first person to read the completed novel, and a new afterword by Sanderson explaining how he came to write the book and its place in the Cosmere, the unified universe of all his Tor novels.

 Also included is an expanded version of the &quot;Ars Arcanum&quot; appendix, with more of the technical details of the book&#x27;s magic that fans can never get enough of.

 With the government of Detritus in disarray because of Superiority treachery, and with Spensa still away on her mission in the Nowhere, Jorgen must work together with the alien Alanik to pick up the pieces. They intercept a strange transmission from the planet Evershore and its Kitsen inhabitants, who say they have some of Jorgen’s people and want to return them - but can the Kitsen be trusted? And can Jorgen learn to master his increasingly erratic cytonic powers before they spiral out of control and destroy all hope of forming an alliance against the Superiority?

Newcago is free. They told David it was impossible, that even the Reckoners had never killed a High Epic. Yet Steelheart - invincible, immortal, unconquerable - is dead. And he died by David&#x27;s hand.

 Eliminating Steelheart was supposed to make life simpler. Instead, it only made David realize he has questions. Big ones. And no one in Newcago can give him answers.

 Babylon Restored, the city formerly known as the borough of Manhattan, has possibilities, though. Ruled by the mysterious High Epic Regalia, Babylon Restored is flooded and miserable, but David is sure it&#x27;s the path that will lead him to what he needs to find. Entering a city oppressed by a High Epic despot is risky, but David&#x27;s willing to take the gamble. Because killing Steelheart left a hole in David&#x27;s heart.

Narrated by Kaleo Griffith and Jennifer Jill Araya.

 All his life, Sixth of the Dusk has been a traditional trapper of Aviar—the supernatural birds his people bond with—on the deadly island of Patji. Then one fateful night he propels his people into a race to modernize before they can be conquered by the Ones Above, invaders from the stars who want to exploit the Aviar.

 But it’s a race they’re losing, and Dusk fears his people will lose themselves in the effort. When a chance comes to sail into the expanse of the emberdark beyond a mystical portal, Dusk sets off to find his people’s salvation with only a canoe, his birds, and all the grit and canniness of a Patji trapper.

 Elsewhere in the emberdark is a young dragon chained in human form: Starling of the starship Dynamic. She and her ragtag crew of exiles are deep in debt and on the brink of losing their freedom. So when she finds an ancient map to a hidden portal between the emberdark and the physical realm, she seizes the chance at a lucrative discovery.

 These unlikely allies might just be the solution to each other’s crisis. In their search for independence, Dusk and Starling face perilous bargains, poisonous politics, and the destructive echo of a dead god.

 Sanderson expands his thrilling novella “Sixth of the Dusk” into a mythic novel of legends, lore, and warring galactic superpowers."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5.jpg" alt="Cover of Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5</td><td>Secret Projects</td><td data-sort="5.0">5</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Kaleo Griffith, Jennifer Jill Araya</td><td>2025-07-10</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>16:53</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Legion- The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds.jpg" data-title="Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds" data-series="Legion" data-index="4" data-author="Brandon Sanderson" data-narrator="Oliver Wyman" data-year="2018-09-18" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="10:12" data-desc="From #1 New York Times best-selling author Brandon Sanderson comes a new novella collection, including a brand-new, never-been-published story.

 Stephen Leeds is perfectly sane. It&#x27;s his hallucinations who are mad.

 A genius of unrivaled aptitude, Stephen can learn any new skill, vocation, or art in a matter of hours. However, to contain all of this, his mind creates hallucinatory people - Stephen calls them aspects - to hold and manifest the information. Wherever he goes, he is joined by a team of imaginary experts to give advice, interpretation, and explanation. He uses them to solve problems...for a price.

 His brain is getting a little crowded and the aspects have a tendency of taking on lives of their own. When a company hires him to recover stolen property - a camera that can allegedly take pictures of the past - Stephen finds himself in an adventure crossing oceans and fighting terrorists. What he discovers may upend the foundation of three major world religions - and, perhaps, give him a vital clue into the true nature of his aspects.

 When the great red star Calamity appeared in the sky, some believed the end had come. They were right.

 Calamity created the Epics: humans with incredible powers they didn&#x27;t deserve.

 They could have saved mankind. They could have lifted us into harmony and prosperity. Instead they burned. They slaughtered. They conquered. And then they ruled.

 Jax has learned all of this the hard way. Orphaned at an early age, he&#x27;s spent most of his childhood training to be a Reckoner - determined to find the Epics&#x27; weaknesses, unlock their secrets, and protect those of us who are still left.

 But now, the mysterious High Epic Lifeforce has arrived with his flying city, Lux, to plunder what&#x27;s left of Texas. So Jax and his ragtag team - the few who remain of the once-mighty Texas Reckoners - must take their battle to this floating fortress of riches - and defeat the invincible.

 In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times best-selling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.

 Dalinar Kholin&#x27;s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost. The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.

 Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar&#x27;s blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Oathbringer.jpg" alt="Cover of Oathbringer" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Oathbringer</td><td>The Stormlight Archive</td><td data-sort="3.0">3</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Kate Reading, Michael Kramer</td><td>2017-11-14</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>55:06</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Sanderson/ReDawn - Skyward Flight, Novella 2.jpg" data-title="ReDawn - Skyward Flight, Novella 2" data-series="The Skyward Series" data-index="2.2" data-author="Brandon Sanderson, Janci Patterson" data-narrator="Suzy Jackson" data-year="2021-10-26" data-genre="Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure" data-duration="6:57" data-desc="From number one best-selling author Brandon Sanderson and Janci Patterson comes the second of three Skyward series novellas, each told from the perspective of a different member of the team back on Detritus.

 “Don’t trust their lies. Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy, the Galactic Superiority, Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space, and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock - a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed?

 When she recovered from her injuries and met the friendly humans Jorgen and FM of Skyward Flight, she found that her warning to Spensa had gone unheeded by the government of Detritus, and they were considering a peace overture from the Superiority. Now having returned to ReDawn, Alanik is dismayed to learn that her own people are falling into the exact same trap.

 The faction in ReDawn’s government that wants to appease the Superiority has gained the upper hand. With Alanik’s mentor, Renakin captured, she has no one to turn to but Jorgen, FM, and their friend Rig. An ancient technology may have the power to save both of their planets from disaster, but can they discover its secrets before it’s too late?

 The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s number-one New York Times best-selling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game.

 After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar’s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.

 Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin’s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.

 At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.

 Spensa&#x27;s world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what&#x27;s left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa&#x27;s dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father&#x27;s - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa&#x27;s chances of attending flight school at slim to none.

 No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Skyward.jpg" alt="Cover of Skyward" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Skyward</td><td>The Skyward Series</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Suzy Jackson</td><td>2018-11-06</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>15:28</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Snapshot.jpg" data-title="Snapshot" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Brandon Sanderson" data-narrator="William Demeritt" data-year="2017-02-17" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Mystery" data-duration="2:22" data-desc="If you could re-create a day, what dark secrets would you uncover?

 From New York Times number-one best-selling author Brandon Sanderson comes a detective thriller in a police beat like no other.

 Anthony Davis and his partner, Chaz, are the only real people in a city of 20 million, sent there by court order to find out what happened in the real world 10 days ago so that hidden evidence can be brought to light and located in the real city today.

 Within the re-created Snapshot of May 1, Davis and Chaz are the ultimate authorities. Flashing their badges will get them past any obstruction and overrule any civil right of the dupes around them. But the crimes the detectives are sent to investigate seem like drudgery - until they stumble upon the grisly results of a mass killing that the precinct headquarters orders them not to investigate. That&#x27;s one order they have to refuse.

 All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she&#x27;s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumors of his cowardice are true - he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them.

 Spensa is sure there&#x27;s more to the story. And she&#x27;s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars - and it was terrifying. Everything Spensa has been taught about her world is a lie.

 But Spensa also discovered a few other things about herself - and she&#x27;ll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to.

 For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the &quot;Sliver of Infinity,&quot; reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler&#x27;s most hellish prison.

 Kelsier &quot;snapped&quot; and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld&#x27;s elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel&#x27;s plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.

 Like him, she&#x27;s a half-Skaa orphan, but she&#x27;s lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

 This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?

 Who is the Hero of Ages?

 To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness—the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists—is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.

 Having escaped death at the climax of The Well of Ascension only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can&#x27;t even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans!

 The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.

 Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

 It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.

 One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

 Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.

 Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar&#x27;s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan&#x27;s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

 The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.

 Speak again the ancient oaths:

 Life before death.

 Strength before weakness.

 Journey before destination.

 And return to men the Shards they once bore.

 The Knights Radiant must stand again.

 The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler - the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years - has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.

 As Kelsier&#x27;s protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.

 Stopping assassins may keep Vin&#x27;s Mistborn skills sharp, but it&#x27;s the least of her problems.

 Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn&#x27;t run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier&#x27;s crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won&#x27;t get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler&#x27;s hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.

 As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.

 Long-listed, Audible.com Best of the Year, 2024

 The long-awaited explosive climax to the first arc of the #1 New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive—the iconic epic fantasy masterpiece that has sold more than 10 million copies, from acclaimed bestselling author Brandon Sanderson.

 Dalinar Kholin challenged the evil god Odium to a contest of champions with the future of Roshar on the line. The Knights Radiant have only ten days to prepare—and the sudden ascension of the crafty and ruthless Taravangian to take Odium’s place has thrown everything into disarray.

 Desperate fighting continues simultaneously worldwide—Adolin in Azir, Sigzil and Venli at the Shattered Plains, and Jasnah in Thaylenah. The former assassin, Szeth, must cleanse his homeland of Shinovar from the dark influence of the Unmade. He is accompanied by Kaladin, who faces a new battle helping Szeth fight his own demons . . . and who must do the same for the insane Herald of the Almighty, Ishar.

 At the same time, Shallan, Renarin, and Rlain work to unravel the mystery behind the Unmade Ba-Ado-Mishram and her involvement in the enslavement of the singer race and in the ancient Knights Radiant killing their spren. And Dalinar and Navani seek an edge against Odium’s champion that can be found only in the Spiritual Realm, where memory and possibility combine in chaos. The fate of the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.

 Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status &quot;darkeyes&quot;. Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.

 The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin’s master has much deeper motives.

 Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.

 Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2.jpg" alt="Cover of Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2</td><td>The Stormlight Archive</td><td data-sort="2.0">2</td><td>Brandon Sanderson</td><td>Michael Kramer, Kate Reading</td><td>2014-03-04</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>48:15</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Brandon Varnell/Catgirl Doctor- The Complete Omnibus - Catgirl Doctor, Books 1-3.jpg" data-title="Catgirl Doctor: The Complete Omnibus - Catgirl Doctor, Books 1-3" data-series="Catgirl Doctor" data-index="1-3" data-author="Brandon Varnell" data-narrator="Jessica Threet, Christopher Boucher" data-year="2020-12-01" data-genre="Erotica:Literature &amp; Fiction:Romantic" data-duration="14:23" data-desc="Contains the complete Catgirl Doctor series.

 In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and to be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”

 In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through 87 of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances - a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection.

 Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power, it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice.

 Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”

 Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.

 Don’t miss the hour-long Netflix special Brené Brown: The Call to Courage!

 Named one of the best books of the year by Bloomberg.

 Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas and has the courage to develop that potential.

 When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it&#x27;s necessary to do good work.

 But daring leadership in a culture that’s defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.

 Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question:

 How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?

 In this new audiobook, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.”

 Whether you’ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this audiobook is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership."><img class="cover" src="covers/Brené Brown/Dare to Lead - Brave Work.

One of his high school classmates, Danny Corwin, was a vicious serial killer who had raped and mutilated six women, murdering three of them. Yet the town had denied all early signs of the radical evil that was growing within Corwin. What had led the local media to ignore his early rapes? Why had the local Presbyterian Church tried to shield him from prison? Why had local law enforcement been unable to solve and prosecute his murders as they continued?

 Burrough is widely admired as a master storyteller, and this chilling tale raises important questions of whether serial killers can be recognized before they kill or rehabilitated after they do. It is also a story of Texas politics and power that led the good citizens of the town of Temple to enable a demon who was their worst nightmare.

 In this very personal work - adapted from the original number one best seller, which the New York Times calls &quot;as compelling as To Kill a Mockingbird, and in some ways more so&quot; - acclaimed lawyer and social justice advocate Bryan Stevenson offers a glimpse into the lives of the wrongfully imprisoned and his efforts to fight for their freedom.

 Stevenson&#x27;s story is one of working to protect basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society - the poor, the wrongly convicted, and those whose lives have been marked by discrimination and marginalization. Through this adaptation, young people of today will find themselves called to action and compassion in the pursuit of justice.

 Proceeds of this book will go to charity to help in Stevenson&#x27;s important work to benefit the voiceless and the vulnerable as they attempt to navigate the broken US justice system.

 Welcome to Cape Carnage! Visit Once, Stay Forever.

 You can hide in the farthest reaches of the deepest hell, and I will still drag you out. Even the devil can’t save you from me.

 Cape Carnage is a seaside town of colorful houses, quirky shops, and an unusually high body count. With tourists comes trouble, and Harper Starling won’t let anyone ruin her picture-perfect home. A skilled gardener with killer instincts, Harper protects her sanctuary—and her aging mentor with a fading memory—at any cost. Troublesome tourists don’t check out of Carnage. They compost beneath Harper’s award-winning flowerbeds.

 But Nolan Rhodes isn’t your average tourist. Devilishly handsome, disarmingly charming, and skilled with a blade, Nolan is relentless in the pursuit of revenge. On every anniversary of the hit-and-run accident that fractured his life, Nolan slays another target. And he’s saved the best for last: the undeniably beautiful Harper Starling. The problem? Harper isn’t the monster he expected. And she won’t go down without a fight.

 When an amateur true crime investigator comes to Cape Carnage on the trail of a long-lost serial killer, Harper and Nolan strike an uneasy truce. If Nolan helps Harper protect her town, she’ll keep quiet about his hunting habits . . . for now. But their alliance soon spirals into obsession, one that threatens to shatter every secret in Carnage—including their fragile love.

 Tourist Season is a darkly funny, slow burn, enemies-to-lovers romance where destruction and desire are balanced on the edge of a blade—and where love is the most dangerous battleground of all.

 Tropes:

 Small-town romance

 Fish out of water

 Grumpy/grumpy

Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate.

 In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn&#x27;t much a girl wouldn&#x27;t do for a glass of water.

 Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen&#x27;s reservoirs for as long as she can remember.

 But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone.

 When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares… but it turns out they&#x27;re real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.

 The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist&#x27;s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him… or her.

 Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate.

 His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he&#x27;s the only way Saeris is going to make it home.

 This Psych 312 assignment just might send me off the deep end. Determining whether love at first sight really exists with Robbie Moravian as my project partner, of all people?

 He’s the sappiest man alive, so upbeat I could scream, and clearly rooting for happy endings at every turn. How does he not learn from experience considering our own meet-cute last semester almost got us expelled?

 But we both need to pass this course to graduate. So we’re interviewing five random couples about their meet-cutes and relationships and spending all this time together. Which is certainly...educational.

 Because it turns out Robbie isn’t just the charming golden boy I thought I knew. There’s some actual depth beneath all those lame dad jokes and the ‘70s-inspired thrift wardrobe (even if he does look ridiculously great in a flared collar). Next thing I know he’s walking me back to my office on the regular and finishing all my sentences and protecting me from freak storms, and...

 Wait. Could Robbie be right? Can happy endings really come from unhappy beginnings? Is he about to change my entire world view?

 Group projects are the worst.

 As the Jedi struggle to curb the carnage of the rampaging Nihil, they come face-to-face with the true fear their enemy plans to unleash across the galaxy - the kind of fear from which even the Force cannot shield them."><img class="cover" src="covers/Cavan Scott/Star Wars- The Rising Storm (The High Republic).jpg" alt="Cover of Star Wars: The Rising Storm (The High Republic)" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Star Wars: The Rising Storm (The High Republic)</td><td>Star Wars: The High Republic</td><td data-sort="5.0">5</td><td>Cavan Scott</td><td>Marc Thompson</td><td>2021-06-29</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Adventure</td><td>15:32</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Cebelius/Mask of the Template- A Monster Girl Harem Fantasy.jpg" data-title="Mask of the Template: A Monster Girl Harem Fantasy - Celestine Chronicles Series, Book 1" data-series="Celestine Chronicles Series" data-index="1" data-author="Cebelius" data-narrator="Tess Irondale" data-year="2018-10-25" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic" data-duration="12:08" data-desc="Not all heroes go to heaven.

 Terrence Mack was born poor, grew up tough, and died hard. Waking up in a sea cave with nothing but the clothes on his back and a new bullet scar was enough to convince him that wherever his death had brought him, it wasn&#x27;t paradise.

 His new world quickly proves to be a place of danger, magic, monsters, and - for Terry at least - women.

 Known on Celestine as a template, Terry&#x27;s genes are key to the survival of the eldritch races. But the fiercely competitive eldritch don&#x27;t typically leave their lovers alive long, and aren&#x27;t accustomed to taking &#x27;no&#x27; for an answer.

 The average life expectancy of a template on Celestine? Three days.

 A city boy with no survival skills to speak of, Terry sets out in a desperate bid to gather allies. With the help of a lonely dryad, a mixed-up minotress, and a misguided party of dungeon delvers, he must be brave, cunning, and good with the ladies to have any hope of living through the month.

 All the while an ancient evil bent on the destruction of Celestine exists in the north, and templates are the key to its southern expansion....

 Long before the First Order, before the Empire, before even The Phantom Menace ...Jedi lit the way for the galaxy in The High Republic

 It is a golden age. Intrepid hyperspace scouts expand the reach of the Republic to the furthest stars, worlds flourish under the benevolent leadership of the Senate, and peace reigns, enforced by the wisdom and strength of the renowned order of Force users known as the Jedi. With the Jedi at the height of their power, the free citizens of the galaxy are confident in their ability to weather any storm But the even brightest light can cast a shadow, and some storms defy any preparation.

 When a shocking catastrophe in hyperspace tears a ship to pieces, the flurry of shrapnel emerging from the disaster threatens an entire system. No sooner does the call for help go out than the Jedi race to the scene. The scope of the emergence, however, is enough to push even Jedi to their limit. As the sky breaks open and destruction rains down upon the peaceful alliance they helped to build, the Jedi must trust in the Force to see them through a day in which a single mistake could cost billions of lives.

 Even as the Jedi battle valiantly against calamity, something truly deadly grows beyond the boundary of the Republic. The hyperspace disaster is far more sinister than the Jedi could ever suspect. A threat hides in the darkness, far from the light of the age, and harbors a secret that could strike fear into even a Jedi’s heart."><img class="cover" src="covers/Charles Soule/Star Wars- Light of the Jedi - The High Republic.jpg" alt="Cover of Star Wars: Light of the Jedi - The High Republic" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Star Wars: Light of the Jedi - The High Republic</td><td>Star Wars: The High Republic</td><td data-sort="4.0">4</td><td>Charles Soule</td><td>Marc Thompson</td><td>2021-01-05</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Movie, TV &amp; Video Game Tie-Ins</td><td>13:35</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Charlie Donlea/The Girl Who Was Taken.jpg" data-title="The Girl Who Was Taken" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Charlie Donlea" data-narrator="Nina Alvamar" data-year="2017-04-25" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Crime Fiction" data-duration="10:49" data-desc="Charlie Donlea, one of the most original new voices in suspense, returns with a haunting novel, laden with twists and high tension, about two abducted girls - one who returns, one who doesn&#x27;t - and the forensics expert searching for answers.

 Nicole Cutty and Megan McDonald are both high school seniors in the small town of Emerson Bay, North Carolina. When they disappear from a beach party one warm summer night, police launch a massive search. No clues are found, and hope is almost lost until Megan miraculously surfaces after escaping from a bunker deep in the woods. A year later the best-selling account of her ordeal has turned Megan from local hero to national celebrity. It&#x27;s a triumphant, inspiring story except for one inconvenient detail: Nicole is still missing.

 Nicole&#x27;s older sister, Livia, a fellow in forensic pathology, expects that one day soon Nicole&#x27;s body will be found, and it will be up to someone like Livia to analyze the evidence and finally determine her sister&#x27;s fate. Instead the first clue to Nicole&#x27;s disappearance comes from another body that shows up in Livia&#x27;s morgue - that of a young man connected to Nicole&#x27;s past. Livia reaches out to Megan for help, hoping to learn more about the night the two were taken. Other girls have gone missing, too, and Livia is increasingly certain the cases are connected. But Megan knows more than she revealed in her blockbuster book. Flashes of memory are coming together, pointing to something darker and more monstrous than her chilling memoir describes.

 Ranger-General. Banshee Queen. Warchief. Sylvanas Windrunner has borne many titles. To some, she is a hero—to others, a villain. But whether in pursuit of justice, vengeance, or something more, Sylvanas has always sought to control her own destiny.

 The power to achieve her goals has never been closer, as Sylvanas works alongside the Jailer to liberate all Azeroth from the prison of fate. Her final task? Secure the fealty of their prisoner—King Anduin Wrynn.

 To succeed, Sylvanas will be forced to reflect on the harrowing path that brought her to the Jailer’s side and to reveal her truest self to her greatest rival. Here, Sylvanas’s complete story is laid bare: the breaking of the Windrunner family and her rise to Ranger- General; her own death at the hands of Arthas and her renewed purpose in founding the Forsaken; the moment she first beheld the Maw and understood the true consequences of what lay beyond the veil of death.

 But as her moment of victory draws near, Sylvanas Windrunner will make a choice that may ultimately come to define her.

 When fifteen-year-old Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy. But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon soon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.

 Overnight his simple life is shattered, and, gifted with only an ancient sword, a loyal dragon, and sage advice from an old storyteller, Eragon is soon swept into a dangerous tapestry of magic, glory, and power.

 But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier. Fleeing his father and a future as a torturer, Hadrian finds himself stranded on a strange, backwater world.

 When the world was young, all life shook before the might of Galakrond, a massive primal dragon whose hunger could not be sated. Five primal dragons rose valiantly beside the titan-forged Keeper Tyr to combat this threat. Though the fight was desperate, Galakrond fell by their teeth and talons, and the five were chosen to become protectors of Azeroth. The titans gifted Nozdormu, Ysera, Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Neltharion with Order magic, transforming them into the Aspects: powerful dragons with command of time, nature, life, magic, even the earth itself. Other primal dragons followed on their path, and, imbued with the titans’ power, the dragonflights rose to shape the world and serve the Aspects.

 That is the tale the dragonflights have always told . . . but it is not the whole story.

 For as Alexstrasza and her flights set to reshaping Azeroth, not all of dragonkind sees Order magic as a gift. Spurning the titans’ interference, a group of rebel primal dragons are imbued with the elemental powers of the planet and are reborn as the Incarnates. Led by Iridikron, the Incarnates believe that dragonkind should be subservient to no one. They foment a rebellion against the Aspects: what they are and all they represent.

 Despite the efforts of Alexstrasza and her primal friend Vyranoth to preserve peace, both sides slip closer to violence, as dragons are forced to choose a side or be swept up in the growing conflict. With battle lines and allegiances drawn, the war among dragonkind shakes the foundation of the world. Both sides realize they will have to make sacrifices to secure the future of their kind, sacrifices that will cascade through the ages."><img class="cover" src="covers/Courtney Alameda/War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft- Dragonflight).jpg" alt="Cover of War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft: Dragonflight)" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft: Dragonflight)</td><td>World of Warcraft</td><td data-sort="">Dragonflight</td><td>Courtney Alameda</td><td>Wendee Lee</td><td>2023-10-31</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>15:36</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Courtney Cole/Mine.jpg" data-title="Mine" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Courtney Cole" data-narrator="Caitlin Davies, Tavia Gilbert" data-year="2019-05-28" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Family Life" data-duration="7:09" data-desc="The USA Today and New York Times best-selling author of the “raw, powerful, heart-wrenching” (Robyn Harding) Saving Beck delivers a riveting and heart-pounding story of a crumbling marriage rocked by an affair - as betrayal and jealousy begin to consume both wife and mistress, forever intertwining their fates.

 The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492.

 Academy Award nominee Diane Lane narrates this tale about a Hollywood power broker who travels to Alabama to convince a reluctant author that the studio’s treatment of his best-selling book would make the perfect blockbuster romantic comedy.

 What Heather Thiesen knows about marriage is that hers is sputtering, anything but romantic, and utterly exhausting. It’s her job to iron out the details of movie deals with people like Brock Lewis, the self-published and conservative author of Atomic Marriage, even if his preachy rules for a happy, thriving marriage make her want to go back to bed. Harried and married, with a young child at home, she can barely get through the book’s 12-point Atomic Doctrine, let alone follow its advice. Make eye contact with your spouse? Always! Use the bathroom in front of them? Never!

 But then she meets Brock. And to her surprise, she likes him—a lot.

 Curtis Sittenfeld is one of America’s funniest and most astute cultural commentators. Diane Lane is one of our best leading actresses, sharing Heather’s perspective with depth, candor, and warmth. Together they deliver a remarkable story about the life partners we choose, the secrets we keep, and the compromises we make—or break."><img class="cover" src="covers/Curtis Sittenfeld/Atomic Marriage.jpg" alt="Cover of Atomic Marriage" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Atomic Marriage</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Curtis Sittenfeld</td><td>Diane Lane</td><td>2019-01-03</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Anthologies &amp; Short Stories:Anthologies</td><td>0:58</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/D.

 What makes Simon Fitch so perfect?

  He knows all her favorite foods, music, and movies. Her son adores him. He was there when she needed him most. He anticipates her every need. He would never betray her like her first husband.  The perfect husband. He checks all the boxes.

 The question is, why?

 Nina Garrity learned the hard way that her missing husband, Glen, had been leading a double life with another woman. But with Glen gone - presumably drowned while fishing on his boat - she couldn&#x27;t confront him about the affair or find closure to the life he blew apart.

 Now, a year and a half later, Nina has found love again and hopes she can put her shattered world back together. Simon, a widower still grieving the death of his first wife, thinks he has found his dream girl in Nina, and his charm and affections help break through to a heart hardened by betrayal. Nina&#x27;s teenage son, Connor, embraces Simon as the father he wishes his dad could have been, while her friends see a different side to him, and they aren&#x27;t afraid to use the word obsession.

 Nina works hard to bridge the divide that’s come between her daughter and Simon. She wants so badly to believe her life is finally getting back on track, but she’ll soon discover that the greatest danger to herself and her children are the lies people tell themselves.

Instead, the new lord needs to face culture shock, contending with strange foods, stringent training, and a stomach-churning subrace of humans known as &quot;Joggers&quot;.

 Grant chose the wrong time to try to take on the world: Every single citizen of February is a powerful body cultivator, and this year there has been a huge shift in the power dynamics of the District. Not only is everyone fervently training, they all have the same end goal as Grant. Only the finalists of the Body-focused tournament get the chance to go head-to-head with Lady February, and Grant is a decade behind.

 People are doing anything they can to get an edge. Grant is happy to introduce them to his blade."><img class="cover" src="covers/Dakota Krout/Lady February.jpg" alt="Cover of Lady February - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 2)" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Lady February - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 2)</td><td>Year of the Sword</td><td data-sort="2.0">2</td><td>Dakota Krout</td><td>Travis Baldree</td><td>2022-02-16</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Cyberpunk</td><td>9:12</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Dakota Krout/Lord January.jpg" data-title="Lord January - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 1)" data-series="Year of the Sword" data-index="1" data-author="Dakota Krout" data-narrator="Travis Baldree" data-year="2022-01-12" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Cyberpunk" data-duration="11:57" data-desc="Time is money.

 Grant Leap is an orphaned, mortal farmhand in a world where cultivation methods and Weapons of Power are jealously guarded and only passed down among family. He’s not content with his lot; as a Januarian, someone living in District January, he should be living the good life just like everyone else. Food, parties, food, entertainment, and food are the minimum requirement. As an orphan, specifically a reviled Leap, there’s not even a chance of being treated as a human.

 When a celestial event pours time magic into his field, coalescing into a lost Weapon of Power, Grant leaps at the opportunity to advance beyond even the scope of standard cultivation. At the first touch of the weapon, the orphan gains everything he’s ever wanted: a Sword and a Name. Also, a pesky mandatory quest with his life as the price of failure. It doesn’t take him long to realize that the best thing for him to do is to sell it and live on borrowed Time.

 Yet, that would never happen. The blade offers him the first major choice he’s ever had to make: surrender to his desires...or live like a king."><img class="cover" src="covers/Dakota Krout/Lord January.jpg" alt="Cover of Lord January - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 1)" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Lord January - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 1)</td><td>Year of the Sword</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Dakota Krout</td><td>Travis Baldree</td><td>2022-01-12</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Cyberpunk</td><td>11:57</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Dakota Krout/Omelet Endgame - Cooking with Disaster, Book 3.jpg" data-title="Omelet Endgame - Cooking with Disaster, Book 3" data-series="Cooking with Disaster" data-index="3" data-author="Dakota Krout" data-narrator="Macleod Andrews" data-year="2024-03-05" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Humorous" data-duration="11:14" data-desc="Food is almost plentiful.

 Nacho and the Chips Guild are expanding rapidly, both in membership as well as reclaiming land for their burgeoning city. The presence of a cook allows people to gather in large numbers without fear of starving to death, though the reluctant Guild Leader knows better than to let people get too comfortable. Careful management of people has never been his forte, but luckily he has surrounded himself with people who can get that job done as he focuses on learning to craft proper meals.

 As Nacho begins to find a sense of peace in his life, he is suddenly thrust into a new battle when the CruxTerrans launch a surprise attack. They seize several of Nacho&#x27;s closest friends and use them to unlock a hidden portal that will determine the fate of Earth as well as CruxTerra. The Guild Leader and his adversaries are thrust into a daunting challenge that neither side is prepared for, testing their abilities...and especially their willpower.

 Joe has started to draw attention to himself and his abilities. While some of the attention is good and allows for personal growth, most of it is from various organizations that feel threatened by the sudden upswing of power that Joe&#x27;s guild - The Wanderers - is attaining.

 As the threat to Earth begins to reach its peak, all of humanity has a choice: flee to Eternium, or stay for an uncertain future. Some stay, some go, some don&#x27;t make the choice quickly enough. In Ardania, the human Kingdom is seeing an unprecedented influx of people. Supply and demand is an issue no matter where you go, as a civilization of a few million can&#x27;t prepare to accept an eighth of Earth&#x27;s inhabitants at once.

 Joe sets out to solve problems where he can, but he can&#x27;t be there for everyone...especially when a group of smiling enforcers are working to bring him down."><img class="cover" src="covers/Dakota Krout/Raze - Completionist Chronicles Series, Book 4.jpg" alt="Cover of Raze - Completionist Chronicles Series, Book 4" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Raze - Completionist Chronicles Series, Book 4</td><td>The Completionist Chronicles</td><td data-sort="4.0">4</td><td>Dakota Krout</td><td>Luke Daniels</td><td>2019-11-12</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>10:28</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Dakota Krout/Red X Wolf - Damsels of Distress, Book 1.jpg" data-title="Red X Wolf - Damsels of Distress, Book 1" data-series="Damsels of Distress" data-index="1" data-author="Dakota Krout" data-narrator="Emily Woo Zeller" data-year="2025-03-18" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Fairy Tales" data-duration="11:31" data-desc="Know when to hold your ground.

 Lily Red, known as &quot;Little Red&quot;, has trained her entire life to become a system-acknowledged scout under her Grandmother&#x27;s guidance. Hunting, tracking, and trap-making—she&#x27;s a master of her craft. But her dreams of joining the elite Scout forces are repeatedly blocked by a leader of the Wyld with a grudge against Grandmother.

 When Lily uncovers an impending invasion by Wolf Warband, brutal raiders from the frozen north, a deadly challenge offered by their war leader sets her pulse racing. She&#x27;s his partner in prophecy, so as far as he&#x27;s concerned she&#x27;s the only person in the way. Little Red races away to warn the Wyld, but the city&#x27;s rulers mock her warnings as fairy tales, dismissing the threat entirely. Undeterred, she vows to protect the people of Canu Moch herself.

 But Lily isn&#x27;t about to back down. She&#x27;ll be the competent protector of the people of Canu Moch—whether they want her or not. With the three city-states planning to ignore the danger, she strikes out on her own, quickly finding herself on the razor&#x27;s edge between duty and ambition as Little Red pits herself against the Big Bad Wolf.

 Rebecca Punzel grew up as an orphan in the slums, only daring to dream small by providing for her found family. In a kingdom where might makes right, and combat skills rule, her first class is practically a curse: golden locks of hair which require no care. Though she&#x27;s in a hairy situation, she works tirelessly to build a modest life for the other orphans.

 At fourteen, every valuable in reach seems to get tangled into her curls. Practically overnight, she&#x27;s blacklisted from working at any reputable business. Losing her internal battle of morality just so she can survive, Rebecca turns to the thieves guild and quickly makes a name for herself as Goldie Locks. But when a job goes wrong and a ruthless alchemist marks her as an endless source of magical material, she has only one option: run.

 When even that fails, she stakes everything on climbing the Brute Queen&#x27;s battle tower. The grand prize of the trial of power is protection and status—marriage to the Crown Prince. Her attempt is practically a joke: without combat skills they&#x27;d never accept the royal and the orphan as a pair. Luckily, winning isn&#x27;t the goal, escaping is. After all . . .

But how did we acquire the most advanced form of communication on Earth? Daniel L. Everett, a &quot;bombshell&quot; linguist and &quot;instant folk hero&quot; (Tom Wolfe, Harper&#x27;s), provides in this sweeping history a comprehensive examination of the evolutionary story of language, from the earliest speaking attempts by hominids to the more than 7,000 languages that exist today.

 Although fossil hunters and linguists have brought us closer to unearthing the true origins of language, Daniel Everett&#x27;s discoveries have upended the contemporary linguistic world, reverberating far beyond academic circles. While conducting field research in the Amazonian rainforest, Everett came across an age-old language nestled amongst a tribe of hunter-gatherers. Challenging long-standing principles in the field, Everett now builds on the theory that language was not intrinsic to our species. In order to truly understand its origins, a more interdisciplinary approach is needed - one that accounts as much for our propensity for culture as it does our biological makeup."><img class="cover" src="covers/Daniel L.

 Leaving Hearthglen behind, the family moved to the center of Queendom, the city of Accord. As the most important city in the Queendom, Accord had been Shaped from the ground up around the central tree that towered above every other structure in the city. The gigantic tree housed all of the city functions, and was the first project the Queens had undertaken on this world.

 Sean knew better than to simply rush off and commit murder. He worked to protect those dear to him, using his Talents and knowledge to bend the rules of the world he found himself in—sometimes near the breaking point—to craft new marvels.

 New doors opened when he healed the sister of Knight Toivo Bloodheart, setting more events into motion. Dame Hallie Bloodheart, for her part, proposed a plan to shield Sean from Lord Sharpeyes’s retaliation. She would marry him, which would raise Sean to the station of Knight.

 Sean accepted the proposal with his wives’ approval, but first, he married Helga, his Chooser. The former Valkyrie was torn over how she should feel about Sean and treat him, but she loved him and was happy to fully join their family.

 With two new wives and his intentions set, Sean went to Lord Sharpeyes’ party. Though his plan to force the Lord into a duel was thwarted, so too was Lord Sharpeye’s plan to murder all of his enemies. The battle left many nobles dead and Lady Sharpeyes indebted to Sean.

 Once all of his troubles in Hearthglen had been dealt with, Sean was ready to move on. While the massive city of Accord was certain to present its own problems, Sean felt confident that he could face them with the backing of his family and friends."><img class="cover" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8.jpg" alt="Cover of Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8</td><td>Binding Words</td><td data-sort="8.0">8</td><td>Daniel Schinhofen</td><td>Andrea Parsneau</td><td>2022-12-07</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic</td><td>12:50</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Aether&#x27;s Blessing - Aether&#x27;s Revival, Book 1.jpg" data-title="Aether&#x27;s Blessing - Aether&#x27;s Revival, Book 1" data-series="Aether&#x27;s Revival" data-index="1" data-author="Daniel Schinhofen" data-narrator="Andrea Parsneau" data-year="2020-08-28" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Sagas" data-duration="17:59" data-desc="Every year, the empire administers the rite of passage into adulthood.

 His personality was forged by his childhood, and he was determined to find a way to make his past work for him.

 As soon as he could, Zander decided to find work as a military contractor. The company he’d badgered for a job eventually hired him, earning him the nickname “Badger.” While most people dropped out of the lifestyle after a few years, Zander had found a place that felt right to him.

 A decade in, he’d even found a couple of friends who stayed on with him. One was Devin Smith, the heavy weapons specialist for the squad and a proud Texan. Another was Selda Engel, their tech specialist. She’d slowly transitioned from a friend to a friend-with-benefits, but even that had started to become more.

 On rotation again, Zander made a vow to ask Selda to recognize their relationship as more than just a casual hookup, planning to do so as soon as they were back off schedule. The universe, however, was about to remind him of a crucial lesson and old adage: “Life is what happens when you’re busy making plans.” Sent out into the desert on what looked like a wild goose chase, they were about to head back when everything changed.

 Shifted by quantum entanglement from Earth to an alien planet, Zander and his squad would have to adapt—and quickly—if they wanted to live. As they tried to understand what was happening, the stark truth of their new reality thrust itself on the shaken humans. Giant machines of war were attacking an equally humongous bug.

 And, quite unfortunately, the giant bug had a lot of little friends. The ensuing firefight ended with Zander left as the sole human survivor. Out of his dimension and wounded, he had to face an entirely new universe, and the Antecedents&#x27; Legacy would soon become the primary focus of his life."><img class="cover" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1</td><td>Antecedents&#x27; Legacy Series</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Daniel Schinhofen</td><td>Andrea Parsneau</td><td>2023-05-30</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Adventure</td><td>10:55</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11.jpg" data-title="Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11" data-series="Binding Words" data-index="11" data-author="Daniel Schinhofen" data-narrator="Andrea Parsneau" data-year="2024-02-09" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction" data-duration="13:45" data-desc="Sean had long waited for his chance to avenge his friends from Oakwood— when the time finally came, it was with several unlikely allies: High Lady Minerva Queensblood, who felt her family owed Sean for helping her son, Commander Queensblood. Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot, who had to walk a thin line to not favor Sean too much, lest she earn the Queens’ ire.

 With his friends and allies, Sean time and again thwarted Lord Truestrike and his minions. He even befriended his daughter, Dame Trisha Truestrike, giving her hope that she might one day see Darragh again. It was when Sean brought down the Greater Vampire, Luka, that High Lady Queensblood pushed for the duel Sean had long sought.

 During the duel, Truestrike’s treachery was revealed when he summoned a Life Bonded dragon to kill Sean. Sean almost died a few times, but even a dragon bowed before him at the end. Ironically, it wasn’t Sean who finally killed Lord Truestrike. No, it was Trisha, who slew her father to avenge her lover, Darragh.

 With Lord Truestrike’s death, Trisha was destined to take over the Truestrike House and have her son returned to her from her father’s grasp. That ended in tragedy, as the spoiled brat struck her down for ‘stealing his birthright.’ His reign only lasted as long as it took the guard to remove his head from his shoulders.

 But more bad news was waiting— the scribes had sent messages to the Queens. Both Winter and Summer were coming, and Sean wouldn’t be able to avoid them. That put him on the clock to pull off what the stories had said he would do: find the Huntsman.

 To manage that, he’d need to figure out how to open a portal back to Earth. If he did, Sean would likely find an old enemy waiting for him; Thor hadn’t forgotten the slights against his name, and he wanted revenge.

 Time was ticking away, and Sean had to work fast. His wives, especially Fiona, were counting on him. Sean had never backed down from a challenge, and he wasn’t about to start now. He’d either figure out how to create a portal, or he’d end up facing the Queens on less than diplomatic terms."><img class="cover" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11.jpg" alt="Cover of Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11</td><td>Binding Words</td><td data-sort="11.0">11</td><td>Daniel Schinhofen</td><td>Andrea Parsneau</td><td>2024-02-09</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction</td><td>13:45</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Flame of War - Binding Words, Book 5.jpg" data-title="Flame of War - Binding Words, Book 5" data-series="Binding Words" data-index="5" data-author="Daniel Schinhofen" data-narrator="Andrea Parsneau" data-year="2021-01-29" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Historical Fiction" data-duration="14:48" data-desc="Forged Bonds was growing fast and becoming the talk of the city.

Sean won the duel handily, once he got past the surprise of facing both Aria and Cuander, Lord Sharpeyes’ prized cuon, and went on to save Aria from death at the hands of Lord Sharpeyes’ son, Knight Evan Sharpeyes.

 But Sean’s troubles are just beginning. The plans Lord Sharpeyes have set into motion began to unfold, setting the stage for events that will push Sean to his limits.

That was always something he hadn’t wanted to do; it might earn him some friends, but the enemies he would certainly make might very well be his undoing.

 His parents died, leaving him with his Uncle Skippy Rodney. Skippy was a bust-out drunk who could barely take care of himself. After being given a child he didn&#x27;t want, he took out the anger he had on the child.

 If that wasn&#x27;t enough for someone to deal with, things got worse for him. His one-time friends got tired of him, making him a target of their boredom and anger. This left the growing child with no safe haven—at school or home, someone was hurting him every day.

 Then, something miraculous happened: the Heavens stepped in, granting him a Sphere. Spontaneous manifestation of a Sphere was very rare, but it happened on occasion. Benedict, while being beaten unconscious and having his bones broken, was suddenly the Holder of a Sphere of Regeneration.

 A passerby broke up the attack on Benedict and got him whisked off to a clinic to see a Healer. The Healer not only found his newest injuries completely repaired, but also the long list of injuries Benedict had endured throughout his life. That examination turned up the fact that Benedict now had a Sphere and, as such, was bound for the Academy to learn how to deal with his new life.

 He was shown around by Agatha, his psychiatrist. She&#x27;d help him learn the things that his school had never told him about Holders. It was also on his first day that he&#x27;d met Atropos Rosaria Foxglove, his roommate, who had her own problems.

 He&#x27;d have to learn to coexist with a roommate who disliked him, all while trying to find his new place as a Holder of a Sphere. One of the few non-elite students, he would have an uphill climb.

 Denmur and Lord Sharpeyes would not let that happen. Using their connections, they put into motion a chain of events that would reverberate across the city of Hearthglen. Sean was called to attend the Lord’s party - he came, bringing all of his family and friends with him.

 Both sides were surprised by events as they unfolded, and it quickly became apparent that conflict would not be denied. With the Einherjar, a Valkyrie, and an old foe, Velin Dykstra, backing them up, Evan Sharpeyes and Klein Denmur challenged Sean to trial by combat.

 Exhausted and with depleted energy, Sean still led his wives onto the field of battle. The fight was bloody and taxing, but in the end, Sean struck down Evan Sharpeyes before collapsing. With his eyesight fading, Sean looked at his wives, but only saw a few female-like figures rushing toward him. The last sound he heard was a great many wings converging on him, and his mind drifted to thoughts of Morrigan....

At the end of that battle, he claimed Helga Helsdottir, soul-bonding her and renaming her Helga Oathsworn. With a Valkyrie by his side, Sean hoped never to lose another loved one to death. His enemies were far from done with him, however.

 Attacks on the association and their families started, claiming lives and hurting Sean’s friends. Finished with just trying to live his life, Sean made plans to take on his enemies directly. The turning point came when Sean confronted Denmur and his group outside the Golden Lion. Helga struck down Denmur’s champion, Knight Mithrilarm, during the ensuing duel, causing Denmur to snap. The fight left Denmur, plus dozens of others, dead. Even that wasn’t the end - the corrupt guards in Lord Sharpeyes’ pay arrested Sean and Helga.

Death could not stop Sean while he had energy to invoke his gifts from the Tuatha. Pushing death away, Sean got back to his feet and killed the guards and magistrate who had tried to murder him.

The plan was to take away Lord Truestrike’s powerbase, then move against him, with Hallie working to strengthen their ties with the nobility. Sean knew better than to get involved with that side of things, knowing he’d just say the wrong things to the wrong people.

 While Hallie worked on alliances, Sean focused on healing, bringing the conflict with Truestrike to the fore— the Lord tried to use his influence to push Sean out of the healing guild. The attempt failed spectacularly, as not only was Sean not thrown out, he ended with the majority of the guild siding with him.

 Having the healers behind him helped Sean do more. Truestrike’s plots to injure the city guard kept being thwarted, and with the healers on his side, Sean was able to save the majors being targeted. His actions in stopping every attempt to destabilize the guards earned him goodwill with Commander Queensblood.

 Beyond helping the guard, Sean also enforced a broken Agreement, bringing him before Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot. He was meant to explain why he’d cost a noble his hand, but Sean did what he always did: he proved his innocence by helping someone. Giving Mackenzie her foot back put her into debt to him, giving him powerful allies just as the gala began.

 The gala was a night of politics. Sean healed those his friends brought him to and tried to not react when he finally met Truestrike. The conflict that happened wasn’t with Lord Truestrike, but his daughter, Trisha. After asking Sean for a dance, the Dame accused Sean of killing Darragh back in Oakwood, then shoved him and stormed off the dance floor.

 With the gala over, Sean wondered what was going to happen next. He’d made more allies, been recognized before all of society by the Advisor, and his clash with Truestrike was known.

Dragons, titans, alien creatures, big and small, all with a hunger for human flesh. Humans who survive the first year will be rewarded.

 After seeing his family killed in the first week, Allistor leads a small group of survivors in their struggle to stay alive. Not satisfied with simple survival, he strives to make himself and his people stronger. The new &quot;magic&quot; RPG system that now governs the planet is something he can work with, and teach others to exploit. Thrust into a leadership position, and with vengeance in his heart, Allistor aims to establish a stronghold, then take the fight to the monsters who seek to enslave his people."><img class="cover" src="covers/Dave Willmarth/Shadow Sun Survival - Shadow Sun, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Shadow Sun Survival - Shadow Sun, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Shadow Sun Survival - Shadow Sun, Book 1</td><td>Shadow Sun</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Dave Willmarth</td><td>Will M.

 Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl.

 There&#x27;s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere. It&#x27;s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin&#x27;s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone he wants to be with - day in, day out, day after day.

 Beneath the light of three moons, the world of Aster Fall lies shattered. Classes are broken, Outsiders are invading, and the future is unknown. The ancient guardians have left and no one knows where they have gone. The fate of the world lies with one young man. Sam Hastern.

 His family has been cursed by a broken class for the last fifty years. No one has ever managed to level it, condemning them to the lowest paying jobs and life in a barren village. It is called Battlefield Reclaimer. The only information he has is the class description that it is an ancient enchanter and smith, along with a quest to seek out a battlefield and learn how to reclaim the artifacts of the past.

 There&#x27;s one more little problem. Sam&#x27;s about to have it even worse when a dungeon exploration leaves him looking distinctly non-human.

 All he wants is to protect his family and study magic, but to do that, he&#x27;ll learn ancient magic and walk in the footsteps of the old rulers of the galaxy.

 A Titan is rising, and the Primal Void is coming with him.

 When Finlay Ashowan joins the staff of the King and Queen of Daxaria, he’s an enigma. No one knows where he comes from or how he came to be where he is, which suits Fin just fine. He’s satisfied simply serving as the royal cook, keeping nosy passersby out of his kitchen, and concocting some truly uncanny meals.

 But Fin’s secret identity doesn’t stay hidden for long. After all, it’s not every day a house witch and his kitten familiar, Kraken, take to meddling in imperial affairs. As his powers are gradually discovered by the court, Fin finds himself involved in a slew of intrigues: going head-to-head with knights with less-than-chivalrous intentions, helping to protect the pregnant queen, fending off the ire of the royal mage, and uncovering a spy in the castle. And that’s only the beginning—because Fin’s past is catching up with him just as his love life is getting complicated . . .

 “I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this book! I didn&#x27;t want this story to end!”—Reese Witherspoon

 “Painfully beautiful.”—The New York Times Book Review

 For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens.

 Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps."><img class="cover" src="covers/Delia Owens/Where the Crawdads Sing.jpg" alt="Cover of Where the Crawdads Sing" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Where the Crawdads Sing</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Delia Owens</td><td>Cassandra Campbell</td><td>2018-08-14</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Coming of Age</td><td>12:12</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Dennis E.

 Being a sentient spaceship really should be more fun. But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can&#x27;t stay out of trouble.

 They&#x27;ve created enough colonies so humanity shouldn&#x27;t go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.

 Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.

 Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.

 Bob Johansson didn&#x27;t believe in an afterlife, so waking up after being killed in a car accident was a shock. To add to the surprise, he is now a sentient computer and the controlling intelligence for a Von Neumann probe.

 Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that&#x27;s the only part of the plan that&#x27;s still in one piece. A system-wide war has killed off 99.9 percent of the human race; nuclear winter is slowly making the Earth uninhabitable; a radical group wants to finish the job on the remnants of humanity; the Brazilian space probes are still out there, still trying to blow up the competition; and the Bobs have discovered a spacefaring species that sees all other life as food.

 Bob left Earth anticipating a life of exploration and blissful solitude. Instead he&#x27;s become a sky god to a primitive native species, the only hope for getting humanity to a new home, and possibly the only thing that can prevent every living thing in the local sphere from ending up as dinner.

 More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate - whatever the cost.

 But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob’s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse’s problems.

 Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender’s trail. But what they discover out in deep space is so unexpected and so complex that it could either save the universe - or pose an existential threat the likes of which the Bobiverse has ever faced.

 Davi has done this all before. She’s tried to be the hero and take down the all-powerful Dark Lord. A hundred times she’s rallied humanity and made the final charge. But the time loop always gets her in the end. Sometimes she’s killed quickly. Sometimes it takes a while. But she’s been defeated every time.

 This time? She’s done being the hero and done being stuck in this endless time loop. If the Dark Lord always wins, then maybe that’s who she needs to be. It’s Davi’s turn to play on the winning side.

 Apprenticed to one of the world&#x27;s most powerful (and supposedly dead) villains, she is thrust into a strange world where the lines that divide superheroes and criminals are more complex than they seem. The education of a villain is not an easy one, and Tori will have to learn quickly if she wants to survive.

 Two years later, ARKUS releases World-Tree Online, a game where players scale a giant tree with thousands of unique game worlds hanging from the branches. The game&#x27;s time-dilation makes it so that one hour of playtime feels like one month to those in-game, allowing humans to virtually extend their lifespans. However, after an old gamer named Vincent joins World-Tree Online, an update begins that stretches the time-dilation to one year for every five seconds. Players are unable to exit the game during the update - with an estimated wait time of three hundred sixty years.

 After experimenting with an exploit, Vincent begins to develop new spells that will take him higher in the game than he ever thought possible. Unfortunately, he crosses paths with the last moderator, a young man named Lucas that uses his mod abilities to torture and subjugate other players.

 Lucas is willing to abuse his power to conquer the World-Tree, but Vincent&#x27;s exploit might just be the key to stopping him.

 Alice Scott is an eternal optimist still dreaming of her big writing break. Hayden Anderson is a Pulitzer-prize winning human thundercloud. And they’re both on balmy Little Crescent Island for the same reason: to write the biography of a woman no one has seen in years—or at least to meet with the octogenarian who claims to be the Margaret Ives. Tragic heiress, former tabloid princess, and daughter of one of the most storied (and scandalous) families of the twentieth century.

 When Margaret invites them both for a one-month trial period, after which she’ll choose the person who’ll tell her story, there are three things keeping Alice’s head in the game.

 One: Alice genuinely likes people, which means people usually like Alice—and she has a whole month to win the legendary woman over.

 Two: She’s ready for this job and the chance to impress her perennially unimpressed family with a Serious Publication.

 Three: Hayden Anderson, who should have no reason to be concerned about losing this book, is glowering at her in a shaken-to-the core way that suggests he sees her as competition.

 But the problem is, Margaret is only giving each of them pieces of her story. Pieces they can’t swap to put together because of an ironclad NDA and an inconvenient yearning pulsing between them every time they’re in the same room.

 Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he&#x27;s spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure.

 So when he sees the flying saucer, he&#x27;s sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness.

 Especially because the alien ship he&#x27;s staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled Armada—in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders.

 As impossible as it seems, what Zack&#x27;s seeing is all too real. And it&#x27;s just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth&#x27;s history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity&#x27;s life in the balance.

 But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can&#x27;t help thinking: Doesn&#x27;t something about this scenario feel a little bit like . . . well . . . fiction?

 At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you&#x27;ve ever heard before."><img class="cover" src="covers/Ernest Cline/Armada - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Armada - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Armada - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Ernest Cline</td><td>Wil Wheaton</td><td>2015-07-14</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense</td><td>11:50</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Ernest Cline/Ready Player One.jpg" data-title="Ready Player One" data-series="Ready Player One" data-index="1" data-author="Ernest Cline" data-narrator="Wil Wheaton" data-year="2011-08-16" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="15:40" data-desc="#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Now a major motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg.

 In the year 2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual world where most of humanity spends their days.

 When the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself.

 Then Wade cracks the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take this prize. The race is on—and the only way to survive is to win.

 An unexpected quest. Two worlds at stake. Are you ready?

 Days after winning OASIS founder James Halliday’s contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that changes everything.

 Hidden within Halliday’s vaults, waiting for his heir to find it, lies a technological advancement that will once again change the world and make the OASIS a thousand times more wondrous - and addictive - than even Wade dreamed possible.

 With it comes a new riddle, and a new quest - a last Easter egg from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious prize.

 And an unexpected, impossibly powerful, and dangerous new rival awaits, one who’ll kill millions to get what he wants.

 Wade’s life and the future of the OASIS are again at stake, but this time, the fate of humanity also hangs in the balance.

 Yangchen’s inexperience may prove to be her greatest asset.

 Plagued by the voices of Avatars before her for as long as she can remember, Yangchen has not yet earned the respect felt for Avatar Szeto, her predecessor. In an era when loyalty is bought rather than earned, she has little reason to trust her counsel.

 When Yangchen travels to Bin-Er in the Earth Kingdom on political business, a chance encounter with an informant named Kavik leads to a wary partnership. Bin-Er is a city ruled by corrupt shang merchants who have become resentful of the mercurial Earth King and his whims. To extract themselves from his influence, the shangs have one solution in mind: a mysterious weapon of mass destruction that would place power squarely in their hands.

 As Yangchen and Kavik seek to thwart the shangs’ plan, their unlikely friendship deepens. But for Yangchen to chart her course as a singularly powerful Avatar, she must learn to rely on her own wisdom above all else.

 Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad&#x27;dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family—and would bring to fruition humankind&#x27;s most ancient and unattainable dream.

 A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.

Wry, wise and often laugh-out-loud funny, it’s a wholly original story that delivers pure pleasure” (People).

 Looking at real estate isn’t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.

 Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them - the bank robber included - desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.

 Proving once again that Backman is “a master of writing delightful, insightful, soulful, character-driven narratives” (USA Today), Anxious People “captures the messy essence of being human….It’s clever and affecting, as likely to make you laugh out loud as it is to make you cry” (The Washington Post).

 Most people don’t even notice them—three tiny figures sitting at the end of a long pier in the corner of one of the most famous paintings in the world. Most people think it’s just a depiction of the sea. But Louisa, an aspiring artist herself, knows otherwise, and she is determined to find out the story of these three enigmatic figures.

 Twenty-five years earlier, in a distant seaside town, a group of teenagers find refuge from their bruising home lives by spending long summer days on an abandoned pier, telling silly jokes, sharing secrets, and committing small acts of rebellion. These lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream, a reason to love.

 Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be placed into eighteen-year-old Louisa’s care. She embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn how the painting came to be and to decide what to do with it. The closer she gets to the painting’s birthplace, the more nervous she becomes about what she’ll find. Louisa is proof that happy endings don’t always take the form we expect in this stunning testament to the transformative, timeless power of friendship and art."><img class="cover" src="covers/Fredrik Backman/My Friends - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of My Friends - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>My Friends - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Fredrik Backman</td><td>Marin Ireland</td><td>2025-05-06</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Friendship</td><td>13:22</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Freida Mcfadden/Death Row - Alibis collection.jpg" data-title="Death Row - Alibis collection" data-series="Alibis Collection" data-index="" data-author="Freida Mcfadden" data-narrator="Lauryn Allman" data-year="2025-06-01" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Crime Thrillers" data-duration="1:44" data-desc="With all hope of an appeal fading away, the fate of a condemned murderess takes a shocking turn in a breathtaking short story by the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Housemaid.

 A Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick

 &quot;Beautifully written and incredibly funny, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is about the importance of friendship and human connection. I fell in love with Eleanor, an eccentric and regimented loner whose life beautifully unfolds after a chance encounter with a stranger; I think you will fall in love, too!&quot; (Reese Witherspoon)

 No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine.

 Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy.

 But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond’s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one.

 Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Reese Witherspoon, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the smart, warm, and uplifting story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

 Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King&#x27;s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert&#x27;s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse - unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen&#x27;s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.

 All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki - whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys."><img class="cover" src="covers/George R.r.

 On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy&#x27;s diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?

 Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: She must return to her tiny hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful 13-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family&#x27;s Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story - and survive this homecoming.

 Seeking women ages 18-32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.

 When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.

 Question number one: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?

 But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking...and what she’s hiding.

 Question number two: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?

 As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.

 Question number three: Should a punishment always fit the crime?

 If Avery Chambers can’t fix you in 10 sessions, she won’t take you on as a client. Her successes are phenomenal—she helps people overcome everything from domineering parents to assault—and almost absorbs the emptiness she sometimes feels since her husband’s death.

 Marissa and Mathew Bishop seem like the golden couple—until Marissa cheats. She wants to repair things, both because she loves her husband and for the sake of their eight-year-old son. After a friend forwards an article about Avery, Marissa takes a chance on this maverick therapist, who lost her license due to controversial methods.

 When the Bishops glide through Avery’s door and Marissa reveals her infidelity, all three are set on a collision course. Because the biggest secrets in the room are still hidden, and it’s no longer simply a marriage that’s in danger.

 But I don&#x27;t care. Not anymore.

 The Story

 Fell times have come to the galaxy. Cadia has fallen, destroyed by the onslaught of Chaos. A Great Rift in the warp has opened, and from its depths spew daemons and the horrors of Old Night.

 But all hope is not lost… A hero, long absent, has returned, and with him comes the wrath of the Ultramarines reborn. Roboute Guilliman has arisen to lead the Imperium out of darkness on a crusade the likes of which has not been seen since the fabled days of the Emperor.

 But never before have the forces of Ruin amassed in such numbers, and nowhere is safe from despoliation. From the dreaded Scourge Stars come the hordes of the Plaguefather, Lord Nurgle, and their pustulent eye is fixed on Macragge. As the Indomitus Crusade rages on, Guilliman races to Ultramar and a confrontation with the Death Guard.

 Matters are complicated once Lucian is given a deadline by the Council of Death: produce his predecessor, who has mysteriously disappeared, or be tortured until he relinquishes his mantle.

 Hunted by parasites, injuresouls, fallen angels, and now his own kind, Lucian must level up in a way he&#x27;s never fathomed before, crafting everything from mechas to bone armor designed to withstand even the strongest attack. He must forge new alliances, realize the impermanence of the alliances he already has made, and even become a Death Hunter if he hopes to save his brother from certain doom.

 But that&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s at stake.

 As Lucian grows closer to his goal, he&#x27;s blindsided by an attack that he never saw coming. He&#x27;s also asked to do something that will reignite a war between the Progeny of Light and the Progeny of Darkness.

 The decision Lucian makes will have grave consequences for his future, and that&#x27;s before his final discovery, one that threatens the very existence of his family.

 It&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle from start to finish. And while Lucian is always up to the challenge, he may not be ready for the consequences.

 Unfortunately for Fischer, cosmic forces rarely care for mortal feelings. He&#x27;s hounded on all sides by inept cults, conspiring nobles, and more magical misunderstandings than those of a preteen relationship. Even his dutiful pet crab is firing energy blades like an anime antagonist.

 So grab your fishing rod and a good snack, and pet your dog for me. The catch of a lifetime awaits!

 LOCUS AWARD FINALIST • A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, NPR, PopSugar, Polygon, The Globe and Mail, She Reads

 Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is the foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius scholar and a meticulous researcher who is writing the world’s first encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people. She could never make small talk at a party—or even get invited to one. And she prefers the company of her books, her dog, Shadow, and the Fair Folk to other people.

 So when she arrives in the hardscrabble village of Hrafnsvik, Emily has no intention of befriending the gruff townsfolk. Nor does she care to spend time with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the townsfolk, muddle Emily’s research, and utterly confound and frustrate her.

 But as Emily gets closer and closer to uncovering the secrets of the Hidden Ones—the most elusive of all faeries—lurking in the shadowy forest outside the town, she also finds herself on the trail of another mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really want? To find the answer, she’ll have to unlock the greatest mystery of all—her own heart.

 AN ELLE BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR

 Emily Wilde is a genius scholar of faerie folklore who just wrote the world’s first comprehensive encyclopedia of faeries. She’s learned many of the secrets of the Hidden Ones on her adventures . . . and also from her fellow scholar and former rival Wendell Bambleby.

 Because Bambleby is more than infuriatingly charming. He’s an exiled faerie king on the run from his murderous mother and in search of a door back to his realm. And despite Emily’s feelings for Bambleby, she’s not ready to accept his proposal of marriage: Loving one of the Fair Folk comes with secrets and dangers.

 She also has a new project to focus on: a map of the realms of faerie. While she is preparing her research, Bambleby lands her in trouble yet again, when assassins sent by his mother invade Cambridge. Now Bambleby and Emily are on another adventure, this time to the picturesque Austrian Alps, where Emily believes they may find the door to Bambleby’s realm and the key to freeing him from his family’s dark plans.

 But with new relationships for the prickly Emily to navigate and dangerous Folk lurking in every forest and hollow, Emily must unravel the mysterious workings of faerie doors and of her own heart.

 Arthur, Brixaby, and their newly reunited retinue will need every trick they can pull from their decks. In the core of the city rests the dark heart of an ancient scourgling eruption—and it’s reawakening.

 I know you don’t want to talk sometimes. Sometimes because it hurts and sometimes because you’re just not supposed to talk about what you want to talk about.

 Sometimes it can be hard to say, “this is beautiful,” when no one else can see what you see. Or, “Here, this is where the pain is.” But some part of you knows, the truth about the words you cannot say is that they only hurt until you say them. They only hurt until the person who needs to hear them, hears them. Because we are human, and the closest we’ve ever come to showing each other who we really are, and how we love, is with words. So I’m going to try to say to you here, what I wish you’d say to me too. Please.

 “You know the most dangerous kind of villain? A woman with nothing left to lose.”

 In a world ruled by the cruel and merciless Stars, Elara has been cursed by fate. A prophecy promises she will fall for a Star, but that it will kill them both.

 So when Ariete, Star of Wrath, War and Chaos, descends to wreak havoc on Elara’s kingdom, she flees her home—the Kingdom of Night—for the neighbouring Helios, Kingdom of Light.

 And strides straight into the arms of an enemy prince.

 Fearing that Ariete might turn his sights to Helios next, Prince Lorenzo is forced to train Elara as a weapon—one worthy of battling against the tyrannical reign of the Stars. But there are shadows even within the Kingdom of Light—and they threaten to reveal the darkness in Lorenzo’s past and the ancient magic that slumbers in Elara’s veins.

 And with it all comes an undeniable, star-crossed pull between Elara and Lorenzo that neither can seem to resist..."><img class="cover" src="covers/Imani Erriu/Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1</td><td>Heavenly Bodies</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Imani Erriu</td><td>Jane Collingwood</td><td>2025-01-14</td><td>Romance:Fantasy</td><td>14:26</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Invayne _/Beyond Respawn- A Gamer&#x27;s Rebirth (Volume 1).jpg" data-title="Beyond Respawn: A Gamer&#x27;s Rebirth (Volume 1)" data-series="Beyond Respawn: A Gamer&#x27;s Rebirth" data-index="1" data-author="Invayne _" data-narrator="Virtual Voice" data-year="2024-08-01" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="4:25" data-desc="Repeating dreams.

 Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum—as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold.

 Whisked away from his comfortable, unambitious life in his hobbit-hole in Bag End by Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves, Bilbo Baggins finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon.

 Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy fighter pilot turned con man. His ship, the Mobius, is home to a ragtag crew of misfits and refugees looking to score a big payday but more often just scratching to pay for fuel. The crew consists of his ex-wife (and pilot), a drunkard, four-handed mechanic, a xeno-predator with the disposition of a 120kg housecat, and the galaxy&#x27;s most-wanted wizard.

 Along the way, the Mobius crew crosses paths with the Black Ocean&#x27;s vilest scum, from pirate fleets to criminal syndicates, and most law-abiding scum, including Earth Interstellar Enhanced Investigative Organization, ARGO high command, and the Convocation of Wizards.

 Time and again, riches lie just out of reach, because for all the talents Carl Ramsey and his crew possess, they&#x27;ve also got an outlaw&#x27;s greatest weakness: a conscience.

 Well, not quite yet. First, Jake has to survive a perilous trek through time if he ever hopes to return home to his friends, his market, and his former world. The last time we saw our intrepid hero, Jake had barely managed to escape being trapped on a dead version of his own world. Using a combination of his new powers, he threw himself backward through time, back to when the god that trapped him first rose to power. There, Jake snatched divinity from the hands of the ascending god, consuming it for himself without any regard for the consequences of his actions. In a surprise twist, such a poorly thought-out plan came with some serious downsides! Now Jake has a big target painted on his back. The jealous gods of this world are hungry for divine power and not afraid to kill another god to get it. Stuck in the past, Jake must learn to navigate a world full of desperate gods, wild monsters, bizarre powers, and weird “cultivating” mortals who claim they can become just as powerful as the gods themselves—as long as they get to sit around contemplating the mysteries of the universe for a few hundred years first. Join Jake on his next grand adventure as he learns what it means to be a newly ascended divinity, how to survive in such a strange new world, and how he might just have an unexpected edge on everyone and everything that’s out to get him—by learning how to craft his own magical cards!

 **Boasting a 4.7-star rating with over 11,000 reviews on Amazon/Audible, this sequel is a must-have for fans of Gamelit novels, wild adventures, and stories about regular people traveling to strange new worlds. Also, stay tuned for the third book in the series, which is gonna be even bigger, crazier, and full of even more magical cards. And it’s coming out in just a couple of months!**

A magical card system. An apocalypse no one could have predicted.

 Jake is working at the neighborhood market under his apartment when the world ends. He expected nuclear war, a computer virus, or even climate change burning everyone to a crisp to bring about the downfall of civilization. But cruel and arbitrary gods from another world? Who would have guessed that?

 When these cruel gods shuffled Earth like a deck of cards, nothing was in the same place anymore. Monsters, dungeons, and magical items appear scattered across the globe. And suddenly, everyone has access to a new, strange magical card system that gives them magical powers.

 Jake, wasting his day slacking off in the cooler, as he usually did, found himself alone in a completely new and very dangerous world. Can he learn to survive? Can he collect enough cards and create a good enough deck to fight back against the monsters that have overtaken his former home? And why are these strange people that look a lot like elves knocking on the door of the market he is hiding in and asking to buy some of his goods?

 The gods may have stacked the deck against him, but Jake just might have a few cards up his sleeve that will help him survive.

But with the prisoner&#x27;s motivations unclear, Alexander must weigh the risks of trusting this enigmatic figure against his own desperate need for a solution. In addition to his personal struggles, Alexander faces the daunting task of securing trade routes for Venice before the pirate threat returns.

 But the region is fraught with danger, as many of the outposts have recently been overrun by powerful monsters or treachery. To survive, Alexander and his legion must rely on new allies, new technology, and strange, unknown powers that Alexander alone might be able to master.

 As Alexander ventures deeper into the unknown, he must also grapple with his own inner demons and find a way to heal his mind and body.

 Alexander and his growing legion have managed to escape Nova Roma and, more importantly, learned that the rest of the world may not be as ravaged by monsters as they had all thought. Join them as they set sail for ancient Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, to try to learn more about the wider world outside Nova Roma. Along the way, they&#x27;ll encounter a growing plague of deadly pirates, deceitful old merchant families out to quash any new competitors in the region, mysterious new allies, and much more.

 Just as Alexander is starting to feel hope that humanity may actually survive, something happens to tear him away from everyone and everything he has come to care about. Lost, shackled, and without the majority of his skills, Alexander will be forced to confront a new side of himself, a darker, more violent side that threatens to take control of his mind and the new powers he has managed to craft for himself. If he can&#x27;t learn to resist the growing corruption of his mind, he may not just be a danger to himself and those he cares about, but may become a danger to the very world itself.

 Scanning trillions of different dimensions, Alexander finally finds a world that is reminiscent of the only time he was ever happy, back when he could play virtual reality games with his only friend. He doesn&#x27;t know why or how such a world exists, but he doesn&#x27;t care. All he cares about is finding a place where he can escape the misery of Earth and start over.

 Join Alexander as he risks it all by downloading his intelligence into a body made from the best stolen technology and bio-enhancements Earth has to offer and takes the plunge through a portal to another world.

 Only this new world isn&#x27;t full of the idyllic adventures and fantasy roleplaying he had hoped to find. Instead, Alexander finds himself trapped in the middle of an ancient city, in a divergent timeline, where monsters have ravaged the world and the only people left alive huddle behind thick walls, struggling to survive.

 To save his new home, Alexander must quickly learn to adapt to his new world, melding magic with technology to give himself an edge over the unending waves of monsters assaulting the city.

 For centuries, the two Great Guilds have controlled the world of Dematr. The Mechanics and the Mages have been bitter rivals, agreeing only on the need to keep the world they rule from changing. But now a Storm approaches, one that could sweep away everything that humans have built. Only one person has any chance of uniting enough of the world behind her to stop the Storm, but the Great Guilds and many others will stop at nothing to defeat her.

 Mari is a brilliant young Mechanic, just out of the Guild Halls, where she has spent most of her life learning how to run the steam locomotives and other devices of her Guild. Alain is the youngest Mage ever to learn how to change the world he sees with the power of his mind. Each has been taught that the works of the other&#x27;s Guild are frauds. But when their caravan is destroyed, they begin to discover how much has been kept from them.

 As they survive danger after danger, Alain discovers what Mari doesn’t know – that she was long ago prophesized as the only one who can save their world. When Mari reawakens emotions he had been taught to deny, Alain realizes he must sacrifice everything to save her. Mari, fighting her own feelings, discovers that only together can she and Alain hope to stay alive and overcome the Dragons of Dorcastle."><img class="cover" src="covers/Jack Campbell/The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1</td><td>The Pillars of Reality</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Jack Campbell</td><td>Macleod Andrews</td><td>2014-12-02</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic</td><td>11:57</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Jack Gantos/The Dented Head of Joey Pigza.jpg" data-title="The Dented Head of Joey Pigza - The Hidden Files of Joey Pigza, Book 1" data-series="Joey Pigza" data-index="6" data-author="Jack Gantos" data-narrator="Jack Gantos" data-year="2018-09-06" data-genre="Children&#x27;s Audiobooks:Literature &amp; Fiction:Humorous Fiction" data-duration="3:40" data-desc="Joey Pigza wants to win!

One Game Master.

 Infinite Worlds is the most popular VRMMORPG on the market. Its maps are so vast, developer Hard Rock Data utilizes a network of highly advanced artificial intelligences to control it. But it’s not without problems.

 That’s why Game Masters like Jeff Driscoll have jobs. The downside? He’s not allowed to play the game. Something about conflicts of interest and favoritism.

 His very boring and tedious job is to help players deal with the occasional bug that slips through the cracks and ensure they enjoy their time playing enough to give a five-star rating. It’s a gig. It pays the bills.

 However, when the AIs unexpectedly issue a rogue patch, the game becomes a buggy mess, and Jeff’s role radically changes. He finds himself as the only Game Master around, dealing with more problems than he can handle. It’s up to Jeff to return Infinite Worlds to normalcy...but will the AIs let him?

 Manufacturing Magic is a unique spin on the LitRPG genre, not just providing the perspective of the players but also of one of those mystical, magical, all-powerful GMs we all dream of being.

 Recent college grad Sam King was hoping for a backpacking trip across Europe as a graduation present. Instead, he’s going to get a different kind of trip: a three-month stint in the ultimate immersive gaming experience. As a lifelong geek, gamer, and outsider, it’s a better gift then he’d ever dreamed.

 But when he jumps feetfirst into the world of Eternium, run by CAL (the Certified Altruistic Lexicon), it’s not exactly what he expected. All he wants is to quest, game, grind some levels, and get his hands on awesome loot. You know, have fun! But the Mage’s College seems to have a very different definition of fun - one involving study, blisteringly strict regulations, aristocratic hierarchy, and tons of pay to play.

 Sam crosses the college and finds himself running for his life with a back-talking book that is far more than it seems and a class that no one has even heard of. If he can navigate the deadly college politics and the looming war with the barbaric Wolfmen, he might just find the fun and adventure he was looking for."><img class="cover" src="covers/James Hunter/Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1</td><td>Wolfman Warlock</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>James Hunter, Dakota Krout</td><td>Nick Podehl</td><td>2020-02-25</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Cyberpunk</td><td>12:50</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/James Hunter/Rogue Dungeon- A litRPG Adventure - The Rogue Dungeon, Book 1.jpg" data-title="Rogue Dungeon: A litRPG Adventure - The Rogue Dungeon, Book 1" data-series="The Rogue Dungeon" data-index="1" data-author="James Hunter, Eden Hudson" data-narrator="Nick Podehl" data-year="2018-09-18" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure:Classics" data-duration="7:42" data-desc="The Resistance is fractured.

 An EMT in 2042 San Diego, Jack knows he won&#x27;t survive the impact of the massive asteroid hurtling towards Earth. After all, he&#x27;s not one of the handful of lucky lottery winners scheduled for rescue. But he did luck into a NexGenVR capsule, which means Jack can risk a one-way trip to the virtual reality world of Viridan Gate Online, a completely immersive online multiplayer fantasy role-playing game, or RPG.

 The transition to Viridian Gate Online (V.G.O.) is irreversible, and will kill Jack&#x27;s corporeal form. And once players transition fully into the world of V.G.O., the risks aren&#x27;t over — from cutthroat fellow players to greedy developers eager to replicate the wealth discrepancies of Earth in virtual reality, V.G.O. is just as dangerous as the &#x27;real world&#x27; was.

 Audi. Vide. Tace.

 The Catenan Republic—the Hierarchy—may rule the world now, but they do not know everything.

 I tell them my name is Vis Telimus. I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilized society in allowing my strength, my drive, and my focus—what they call Will—to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do.

 I tell them that I belong, and they believe me.

 But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart.

 And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family.

 To survive, though, I will still have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. I will have to smile, and make friends, and pretend to be one of them and win. Because if I cannot, then those who want to control me, who know my real name, will no longer have any use for me.

 And if the Hierarchy finds out who I truly am, they will kill me."><img class="cover" src="covers/James Islington/The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1</td><td>Hierarchy</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>James Islington</td><td>Euan Morton</td><td>2023-05-23</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>28:14</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/James J.

 On the streets of Boston, the world is divided into the ordinary Usuals, and the paranormal Unorthodox. And in the Department of Unorthodox Affairs, the Auditors are the magical elite, government-sanctioned witches with spells at their command and all the power and prestige that comes with it. Grimshaw Griswald Grimsby is…not one of those witches.

 After flunking out of the Auditor training program and being dismissed as “not Department material,” Grimsby tried to resign himself to life as a mediocre witch. But he can’t help hoping he’ll somehow, someway, get another chance to prove his skill. That opportunity comes with a price when his former mentor, aka the most dangerous witch alive, is murdered down the street from where he works, and Grimsby is the Auditors’ number one suspect.

 Proving his innocence will require more than a little legwork, and after forming a strange alliance with the retired legend known as the Huntsman and a mysterious being from Elsewhere, Grimsby is abruptly thrown into a life of adventure, whether he wants it or not. Now all he has to do is find the real killer, avoid the Auditors on his trail, and most importantly, stay alive."><img class="cover" src="covers/James J.

 Who’s really following you on social media? The scam of a lifetime brings together two wildly different women in this page-turning thriller about greed, legacy, and betrayal from the New York Times bestselling author of Watch Me Disappear.

 An ID Book Club Selection • “It’s Dynasty meets Patricia Highsmith.” (The Washington Post)

 Nina once bought into the idea that her fancy liberal arts degree would lead to a fulfilling career. When that dream crashed, she turned to stealing from rich kids in LA alongside her wily Irish boyfriend, Lachlan. Nina learned from the best: Her mother was the original con artist, hustling to give her daughter a decent childhood despite their wayward life. But when her mom gets sick, Nina puts everything on the line to help her, even if it means running her most audacious, dangerous scam yet.

 Vanessa is a privileged young heiress who wanted to make her mark in the world. Instead she becomes an Instagram influencer - traveling the globe, receiving free clothes and products, and posing for pictures in exotic locales. But behind the covetable façade is a life marked by tragedy.

 Only five days have passed since Jade was brought to a distant world and a new life. Mobile for the first time ever, Jade is given the chance to do something she’s always wanted: attend school.

 Dracona isn’t your typical school, however. In Andara she needs to learn all the skills an adventurer needs. For her, that means how to cast magic and use weapons without hurting herself. She’ll have to learn fast because the obstacle course isn’t the only thing challenging her progress; she’s racing against the clock to learn how to beat the Mesmer before they find her.

 With both enemies and allies all around, Jade must hit the ground running, because what’s chasing her may be worse than the hospital bed she left behind.

In a race against time to protect what’s left, her only choice is to fight fae above her magic class and shine a light into the darkness.

 As the smoke clears, Jade learns that the Dark One’s monsters weren’t the only thing she should be wary of. Something none of them were expecting slipped through the cracks. If dealing with nobles concerned more about pride than sense wasn’t bad enough, she’ll have to figure out how to handle the existences that could wipe a crumbling city from the map if she’s not careful: baby dragons.

 The wilderness is a terrifying place, especially when you&#x27;re hunting mesmer...and everything else is hunting you. Unfortunately, getting out of the forest won&#x27;t get her out of the woods.

 A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam &amp; Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.

 Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.

 In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam &amp; Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.

 Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair."><img class="cover" src="covers/Jennette Mccurdy/I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died.jpg" alt="Cover of I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Jennette Mccurdy</td><td>Jennette Mccurdy</td><td>2022-08-09</td><td>Biographies &amp; Memoirs:Entertainment &amp; Celebrities</td><td>6:26</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Jennifer L.

 A Maiden...

 Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.

 A Duty...

 The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.

 A Kingdom...

 Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel."><img class="cover" src="covers/Jennifer L.

 From #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout comes book three in her Blood and Ash series.

 She&#x27;s been the victim and the survivor...

 Poppy never dreamed she would find the love she’s found with Prince Casteel. She wants to revel in her happiness but first they must free his brother and find hers. It’s a dangerous mission and one with far-reaching consequences neither dreamed of. Because Poppy is the Chosen, the Blessed. The true ruler of Atlantia. She carries the blood of the King of Gods within her. By right the crown and the kingdom are hers.

 The enemy and the warrior...

 Poppy has only ever wanted to control her own life, not the lives of others, but now she must choose to either forsake her birthright or seize the gilded crown and become the Queen of Flesh and Fire. But as the kingdoms’ dark sins and blood-drenched secrets finally unravel, a long-forgotten power rises to pose a genuine threat. And they will stop at nothing to ensure that the crown never sits upon Poppy’s head.

 A lover and heartmate...

 But the greatest threat to them and to Atlantia is what awaits in the far west, where the Queen of Blood and Ash has her own plans, ones she has waited hundreds of years to carry out. Poppy and Casteel must consider the impossible - travel to the Lands of the Gods and wake the King himself. And as shocking secrets and the harshest betrayals come to light, and enemies emerge to threaten everything Poppy and Casteel have fought for, they will discover just how far they are willing to go for their people - and each other.

 Of course, it won’t be an ordinary, everyday assassination. Mab wants her newest minion to pull off the impossible: kill an immortal. No problem there, right? And to make matters worse, there exists a growing threat to an unfathomable source of magic that could land Harry in the sort of trouble that will make death look like a holiday.

 Beset by enemies new and old, Harry must gather his friends and allies, prevent the annihilation of countless innocents, and find a way out of his eternal subservience before his newfound powers claim the only thing he has left to call his own… his soul."><img class="cover" src="covers/Jim Butcher/Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14.jpg" alt="Cover of Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14</td><td>The Dresden Files</td><td data-sort="14.0">14</td><td>Jim Butcher</td><td>James Marsters</td><td>2012-11-27</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Mystery:Private Investigators</td><td>18:47</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Jim Butcher/Dead Beat - The Dresden Files, Book 7.jpg" data-title="Dead Beat - The Dresden Files, Book 7" data-series="The Dresden Files" data-index="7" data-author="Jim Butcher" data-narrator="James Marsters" data-year="2010-04-06" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Mystery:Private Investigators" data-duration="15:07" data-desc="When a killer vampire threatens to destroy head of Special Investigations Karrin Murphy&#x27;s reputation, unless Harry delivers the powerful Word of Kemmler to her, he has no choice.

 An old bargain has placed Harry in debt to Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, the Queen of Air and Darkness - and she&#x27;s calling in her marker. It&#x27;s a small favor he can&#x27;t refuse, one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally, and one that will strain his skills-and loyalties-to their very limits.

  It figures. Everything was going too well to last....

 Millions of dungeons inhabit the planet, utilizing the various human kingdoms as a source of much-needed mana to facilitate their own growth; in turn, the humans delve into the dungeons and acquire their own power in the form of essence, which allows them to develop and enhance themselves in a multitude of different ways.

 It is a symbiotic relationship that has lasted centuries and has brought about a measure of peace.

 Far in the Northern wilds where no humans (and therefore - no dungeons) regularly frequent, a young man is left alone when his parents are murdered suddenly and unexpectedly.

 Now, without friends, family, or even supplies, he embarks on a journey to find out who targeted his parents - and upon whom he needs to enact his revenge.

 Along the way, he discovers something about himself that his parents said was impossible from the moment he was born.

 Will he learn to control the new powers he has gained, or will his newly awakened dungeon core abilities consume him?

 For fans of Girl, Interrupted, Thirteen Reasons Why, and All the Bright Places comes a novel Nicola Yoon, author of Everything, Everything, calls &quot;a haunting, beautiful, and necessary book that will stay with you long after you&#x27;ve read the last page&quot;.

 Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At 17 she&#x27;s already lost more than most people do in a lifetime. But she&#x27;s learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don&#x27;t have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you.

 Every new scar hardens Charlie&#x27;s heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge.

 A deeply moving portrait of a girl in a world that owes her nothing, and has taken so much, and the journey she undergoes to put herself back together. Kathleen Glasgow&#x27;s debut is heartbreakingly real and unflinchingly honest. It&#x27;s a story you won&#x27;t be able to look away from.

 Includes an author&#x27;s note read by the author.

 &quot;Raw, visceral, and starkly beautiful, with writing that is at times transcendent in its brilliance.... An unforgettable story of trauma and resilience.&quot; (Kerry Kletter, author of The First Time She Drowned)

 &quot;A breathtakingly written book about pain and hard-won healing.... I want every girl to read Girl in Pieces.&quot; (Kara Thomas, author of The Darkest Corners)

 “A Girl, Interrupted for a new generation.... The story of the mad girl is ultimately a story about being a girl in a mad world, how it breaks us into pieces and how we glue ourselves back together.&quot; (Melissa Febos, author of Whip Smart and Abandon Me)

 “Dark, frank, and tender, Girl in Pieces keeps the reader electrified for its entire journey. You’re so uncertain if Charlie will heal, so fully immersed in hoping she does.” (Michelle Wildgen, author of Bread and Butter and You’re Not You)

 There are only two rules to the game. Stay alive. And don’t fall in love.

 When Ophelia’s sister disappears, there is only one way to save her. Ophelia must enter Phantasma, a deadly contest inside a haunted mansion, and claim its prize—a single wish.

 Phantasma is a maze of twisting corridors and lavish ballrooms, of demons and temptations. Ophelia will face nine challenges, each more dangerous than the last. There can only be one winner, and the other contestants will stop at nothing to eliminate their rivals.

 Every day the house creates new monsters. But just as Ophelia’s fears threaten to overwhelm her, a mysterious stranger offers her a bargain.

 Charming, arrogant and infuriatingly attractive, Blackwell claims he can guide her through the lethal trials ahead. All he asks in return is ten years of her life.

 Ophelia knows she shouldn’t trust him. Blackwell doesn’t seem dangerous, but appearances can be deceptive. Worse still, she feels a dark and irresistible attraction drawing them closer and closer.

 Her life is on the line. But in Phantasma, the only thing deadlier than losing the game is losing your heart…

 There are whispers about what lurks in Witch Knell—the forest where sinners go to die. The villagers call it The Eating Woods because what&#x27;s taken is never given back. Only those who&#x27;ve lost their senses would dare to go near it.

 Or the banished.

 Maevyth Bronwick knows better than to breach the misty labyrinth of trees, but a tragic turn of events compels her beyond the archway of bones to a boundary no mortal has crossed before. One that cloaks a dark and fantastical world that&#x27;s as dangerous as it is alluring.

 It&#x27;s there that he dwells, the cursed lord of Eidolon. The one tasked to keep her hidden from the magehood that seeks to crucify her in the name of an arcane prophecy. Zevander Rydainn, known to his prey as The Scorpion, is the coldest, most calculated assassin in all of Aethyria, and he&#x27;d sooner toss his feisty ward to a pack of vicious fyredrakes than keep her safe.

 If only he could.

 Maevyth&#x27;s blood is the key to breaking his despised curse and vanquishing the slumbering evil in Witch Knell. Unfortunately for Lord Rydainn, fate has other plans for the irresistible little enchantress. And his growing obsession with her threatens to destroy everything.

 Beth Murphy is on the run....

 For nearly a year, Beth has been planning for her escape. She&#x27;s thought through everything - a new look, new name and new city - because one small slip and her husband will find her.

 Sabine Hardison is missing....

 A couple hundred miles away, Jeffrey returns home from a work trip to find his wife, Sabine, is missing. Wherever she is, she’s taken almost nothing with her. Her abandoned car is the only evidence the police have, and all signs point to foul play.

 As the police search for leads, the case becomes more and more convoluted. Sabine’s carefully laid plans for her future indicate trouble at home, and a husband who would be better off with her gone. But are things really as clear cut as they seem? Where is Sabine? And who is Beth? The only thing that’s certain is that someone is lying and the truth won’t stay buried for long.

 A haunting novel from the author of The Weight of Blood about a young woman’s return to her childhood home - and her encounter with the memories and family secrets it holds

 TW Thriller Award Finalist

 Arrowood is the most ornate and grand of the historical houses that line the Mississippi River in southern Iowa. But the house has a mystery it has never revealed: It’s where Arden Arrowood’s younger twin sisters vanished on her watch 20 years ago - never to be seen again. After the twins’ disappearance, Arden’s parents divorced and the Arrowoods left the big house that had been in their family for generations. And Arden’s own life has fallen apart: She can’t finish her master’s thesis, and a misguided love affair has ended badly. She has held on to the hope that her sisters are still alive, and it seems she can’t move forward until she finds them.

 When her father dies and she inherits Arrowood, Arden returns to her childhood home determined to discover what really happened to her sisters that traumatic summer. Arden’s return to the town of Keokuk - and the now infamous house that bears her name - is greeted with curiosity. But she is welcomed back by her old neighbor and first love, Ben Ferris, whose family, she slowly learns, knows more about the Arrowoods’ secrets and their small, closed community than she ever realized.

 With the help of a young amateur investigator, Arden tracks down the man who was the prime suspect in the kidnapping. But the house and the surrounding town hold their secrets close - and the truth, when Arden finds it, is more devastating than she ever could have imagined.

 Arrowood is a powerful and resonant novel that examines the ways in which our lives are shaped by memory. As with her award-winning debut novel, The Weight of Blood, Laura McHugh has written a thrilling novel in which nothing is as it seems, and in which our longing for the past can take hold of the present in insidious and haunting ways.

 Praise for Arrowood

 “This robust, old-fashioned gothic mystery has everything you’re looking for: a creepy old house, a tenant with a secret history, and even a few ghosts. Laura McHugh’s novel sits at the intersection of memory and history, astutely asking whether we carry the past or it carries us.” (Jodi Picoult)

 “An eloquently eerie tale.” (Booklist)

  “Poignant...lyrical.” (Publishers Weekly [starred review])

 “A chilling, twisting tale of family, memory, and home... This engaging and thrilling tale about a young woman’s homecoming, the vagaries of memory, and the impact of tragedy on both a town and a family is a terrific choice for Laura Lippman and Sue Grafton readers.” (Library Journal [starred review])"><img class="cover" src="covers/Laura Mchugh/Arrowood - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Arrowood - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Arrowood - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Laura Mchugh</td><td>Sarah Scott</td><td>2016-08-09</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Literary Fiction</td><td>10:18</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Lauren Blakely/Lucky Suit.jpg" data-title="Lucky Suit" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Lauren Blakely" data-narrator="Zachary Webber, Andi Arndt" data-year="2019-01-31" data-genre="Romance:Contemporary" data-duration="2:25" data-desc="Best-selling romance maestro Lauren Blakely returns with an Audible Original packed with the charm, chemistry, and comedy fans have come to know and love - brought to life by Hall of Fame narrator Andi Arndt and audio heartthrob Zachary Webber.

Now, I’m the grumpy to Juliet’s sunshine on a popular dating podcast we host, and when a wealthy fan gives us a charming coastal cottage as the biggest thank you ever, we head to the town where I grew up to give it a makeover.

 And find the house has only one bed.

 Located under a mirrored ceiling.

 To make matters even harder, the bright, big-hearted woman I’ve been pining for tells me she wants to try to find the one and would I please be her dating coach for the week?

 Like hell I’ll let her date other men. I’ll coach her on three dates with me.

 But the second I take her out, I don’t feel like her teacher. I feel like she’s mine, especially when the first night ends with us tangled up together in that bed.

 Each night we grow closer, but this dating experiment forces me to face my greatest fear–whether a man like me is worthy of her love.

What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?

 Krauss’ answers to these and other timeless questions, in a wildly popular lecture on YouTube, has attracted almost a million viewers. The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. Scientists have, however, historically focused on more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which could help us to improve our quality of life.

 In this cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains groundbreaking scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their head. One of the few prominent scientists to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is indeed addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing—with surprising and fascinating results. The beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending theories are all described accessibly, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing.

 With his characteristic wry humor and clear explanations, Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it will end. It will provoke, challenge, and delight listeners as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future has profound consequences and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins described it, this could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin."><img class="cover" src="covers/Lawrence M.

 In this grand poetic vision of the universe, Lawrence Krauss tells the dramatic story of the discovery of the hidden world that underlies reality - and our place within it.

 Reality is not what you think or sense - it’s weird, wild, and counterintuitive, and its inner workings seem at least as implausible as the idea that something can come from nothing.

 With his trademark wit and accessible style, Krauss leads us to realms so small that they are invisible to microscopes, to the birth and rebirth of light, and into the natural forces that govern our existence. His unique blend of rigorous research and engaging storytelling invites us into the lives and minds of remarkable scientists who have helped unravel the unexpected fabric of reality with reasoning rather than superstition and dogma, and to explain how everything we see - and can’t see - came about. A passionate advocate for reason, Krauss gives the rationale for the seemingly irrational - and the mysteries and apparent contradictions of quantum physics, and explores what that means for our lives here on Earth - and beyond.

 At its core, The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far is about the best of what it means to be human - an epic history of our ultimately purposeless universe that addresses the question, “Why are we here?”

 Kitty Harris has it all: cosily coupled up with boyfriend Archie, she’s putting in the hours at an ad agency to land her dream job. OK, so maybe they’ve become a bit too cosy in their routine, with pizza night every Thursday, and maybe the agency isn’t so much up-and-coming as been-and-gone, but Kitty is happy.

 Until one diamond ring sitting pretty in her pepperoni ruins everything. Kitty does NOT want to get married, not after being caught in the crosshairs of her parent’s destructive divorce. Desperate not to lose Archie altogether, Kitty takes a summer-long break so she can turn her ‘I don’t’ into ‘I do’. Somehow.

 Enter Leo Evans, Kitty’s impeccably dressed advertising nemesis who loves to appear at the very worst moment. Needing a distraction of his own, Leo claims to have the cure for Kitty’s cold feet: a no-strings rebound fling and a ten-date plan to face her marriage fears. Kitty shouldn’t really be fraternizing with the gorgeous enemy, not when they’re about to go head-to-head for the biggest pitch of their careers, but if it means getting her happily-ever-after with Archie, it’s a risk she’s willing to take.

The famous actress has a proposition: Due to their uncanny resemblance, Fangli wants Gracie to be her stand-in. The catch? Gracie will have to be escorted by Sam, the most attractive - and infuriating - man Gracie’s ever met.

 If it means getting the money she needs for her mother, Gracie’s in. Soon Gracie moves into a world of luxury she never knew existed. But resisting Sam, and playing the role of an elegant movie star, proves more difficult than she ever imagined - especially when she learns the real reason Fangli so desperately needs her help. In the end, all the lists in the world won’t be able to help Gracie keep up this elaborate ruse without losing herself...and her heart."><img class="cover" src="covers/Lily Chu/The Stand-In.jpg" alt="Cover of The Stand-In" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Stand-In</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Lily Chu</td><td>Phillipa Soo</td><td>2021-07-15</td><td>Romance:Contemporary</td><td>10:55</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Linda Keir/The Three Mrs. Wrights - A Novel.jpg" data-title="The Three Mrs. Wrights - A Novel" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Linda Keir" data-narrator="Teri Schnaubelt" data-year="2020-09-29" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Women&#x27;s Fiction" data-duration="10:09" data-desc="Mr. Wright has everything.

A MOST ANTICIPATED SUMMER READ from People, USA TODAY, theSkimm, E! News, Forbes, New York Post, CrimeReads, and many more!

 From #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jewell, three women are connected by one man in this kaleidoscopic thriller.

 He’s the perfect man. It’s a perfect lie.

Nina Swann is intrigued when she received a condolence card from Nick Radcliffe, an old friend of her late husband, who is looking to connect after her husband’s unexpected death. Nick is a man of substance and good taste. He has a smile that could melt the coldest heart and a knack for putting others at ease. But to Nina’s adult daughter, Ash, Nick seems too slick, too polished, too good to be true. Without telling her mother, Ash begins digging into Nick’s past. What she finds is more than unsettling…

Martha is a florist living in a neighboring town with her infant daughter and her devoted husband, Alistair. But lately, Alistair has been traveling more and more frequently for work, disappearing for days at a time. When Martha questions him about his frequent absences, he always has a legitimate explanation, but Martha can’t share the feeling that something isn’t right.

Nina, Martha, and Ash are on a collision course with a shocking truth that is far darker than anyone could have imagined. And all three are about to wish they had heeded the same warning: Don’t let him in. But the past won’t stay buried forever."><img class="cover" src="covers/Lisa Jewell/Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Lisa Jewell</td><td>Richard Armitage, Joanne Froggatt, Tamaryn Payne, Gemma Whelan, Louise Brealey, Patience Tomlinson</td><td>2025-06-24</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Domestic Thrillers</td><td>11:58</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Lisa Jewell/Then She Was Gone - A Novel.jpg" data-title="Then She Was Gone - A Novel" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Lisa Jewell" data-narrator="Helen Duff" data-year="2018-04-17" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Family Life" data-duration="10:12" data-desc="Fifteen-year-old Ellie Mack was the perfect daughter.

 &quot;An irresistibly addictive tour of the human condition.&quot; (Kirkus, starred review)

 &quot;Rarely have I read a book that challenged me to see myself in an entirely new light, and was at the same time laugh-out-loud funny and utterly absorbing.&quot; (Katie Couric)

 &quot;This is a daring, delightful, and transformative book.&quot; (Arianna Huffington, founder, Huffington Post and founder &amp; CEO, Thrive Global)

 &quot;Wise, warm, smart, and funny. You must read this book.&quot; (Susan Cain, New York Times best-selling author of Quiet)

 From a New York Times best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist&#x27;s world - where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).

 One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose of­fice she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.

 As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients&#x27; lives - a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a 20-something who can&#x27;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys - she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.

 With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.

 Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them."><img class="cover" src="covers/Lori Gottlieb/Maybe You Should Talk to Someone.jpg" alt="Cover of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone - A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone - A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Lori Gottlieb</td><td>Brittany Pressley</td><td>2019-04-02</td><td>Biographies &amp; Memoirs</td><td>14:21</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Lucy Dawson/Don&#x27;t Ever Tell.jpg" data-title="Don&#x27;t Ever Tell" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Lucy Dawson" data-narrator="Georgia Maguire, Rachel Atkins" data-year="2019-06-25" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Psychological" data-duration="9:44" data-desc="Never make a promise you can’t afford to keep … This is a story about Charlotte – a mother and a wife with the perfect job, the perfect life … at least, that’s how it looks from the outside.

 Lazarus Cain is a member of the Grim Shadows, one of the Thieves Guilds in the city of Eberia. Unfortunately, Lazarus is having a bad day. Waking up in a torture chamber, suffering from amnesia, he&#x27;d be pretty much screwed if not for the mysterious, magical sigil burned into his chest.

 Sometimes a really bad day should be shared with others, especially professional torturers.

 Lazarus will need to use all his cunning and skill to work with his comrades, uncovering schemes within schemes, discovering that The Grim Shadows are not the only Thieves Guild in the city mired in conflict.

 Casting the Runes - adapted by Stephen Gallagher

 When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - The Truth of Alchemy, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.

 On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: &#x27;In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.&#x27; Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse?

 Lost Hearts - adapted by A. K. Benedict

 Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.

 The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas - adapted by Jonathan Barnes

 When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.

 A View from a Hill - adapted by Mark Morris

 Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, &#x27;Mummy.&#x27; Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill."><img class="cover" src="covers/M. R. James/The Conception of Terror- Tales Inspired by M. R.

 All Systems Red tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans.

 In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.

 But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn&#x27;t a primary concern.

 On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied &#x27;droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as &quot;Murderbot.&quot;

 Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it&#x27;s up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth."><img class="cover" src="covers/Martha Wells/All Systems Red.jpg" alt="Cover of All Systems Red" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>All Systems Red</td><td>Murderbot Diaries</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Martha Wells</td><td>Kevin R.

 Born to a prominent Chicago judge and his stifled socialite wife, Mia Dennett moves against the grain as a young inner-city art teacher. One night, Mia enters a bar to meet her on-again, off-again boyfriend. But when he doesn&#x27;t show, she unwisely leaves with an enigmatic stranger. With his smooth moves and modest wit, Colin Thatcher seems at first like a safe one-night stand. But following Colin home will turn out to be the worst mistake of Mia&#x27;s life.

 Colin&#x27;s job was to abduct Mia as part of a wild extortion plot and deliver her to his employers. But the plan takes an unexpected turn when Colin suddenly decides to hide Mia in a secluded cabin in rural Minnesota, evading the police and his deadly superiors. Mia&#x27;s mother, Eve, and Detective Gabe Hoffman will stop at nothing to find them, but no one could have predicted the emotional entanglements that eventually cause this family&#x27;s world to shatter.

 Equal parts artist, survivor, explorer, and battle junkie, Sam&#x27;s only limitation is her lack of knowledge about her new magical powers and the System controlling her new reality.

 The ratings and views are off the chart. The fans just can&#x27;t get enough. The dungeon gets more dangerous each day. But in a grinder designed to chew up and spit out crawlers by the millions, Carl and Princess Donut need to work harder than ever just to survive.

 They call it the Over City. A sprawling, once-thriving metropolis devastated by a mysterious calamity. But these streets are far from abandoned. An undead circus trawls the ruins. Murdered prostitutes rain from the sky. An ancient spell is finally ready to reveal its dark purpose.

 Carl still has no pants.

 A man. His ex-girlfriend&#x27;s cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.

 In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth - from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds - collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.

 The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.

 Only a few dare venture inside. But once you&#x27;re in, you can&#x27;t get out. And what&#x27;s worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it&#x27;s game over. In this game, it&#x27;s not about your strength or your dexterity. It&#x27;s about your followers, your views. Your clout. It&#x27;s about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.

 You can&#x27;t just survive here. You gotta survive big.

 You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that &quot;it&quot; factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That&#x27;s the only way to truly survive in this game - with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.

 As the remaining crawlers battle for their lives, a new, terrible threat looms. Outside, tourists are finally allowed to enter the game, and they are here and ready to hunt. Among them is Vrah, a famed and veteran hunter, intent on collecting the biggest trophy of her career.

 The Iron Tangle. An impossibly complicated subway system built out of the world&#x27;s subterranean railway systems, all combined and then tied together into a knot. Up is down. Down is up. Close is far. The cars are filled with monsters, the railway stations are less than safe, and the exit is always just a few stops away.

 But there is hope. For the first time, the crawlers are all working together. The loot is better than ever. And the secret to unraveling it all may be hidden in the pages of a seemingly useless book.

 It is bedlam on the eighth floor.

 As management reels from the unexpected conclusion of the seventh level, the surviving crawlers stumble onto the eighth and find themselves scattered. It’s a map based on Earth’s final days before the collapse, where ethereal, intangible ghosts of humanity go about their lives, oblivious of the impending doom. Living amongst these ghosts are monsters based in Earth lore. “Legendary” creatures tied to the geographical location they inhabit.

 Each team of crawlers is given a task: find and capture six of these beasts. The captured monsters will be turned into cards. Cards that can be summoned into battle again and again. The stronger and deadlier the better.

 At the end of the floor, the bad guys will also have decks, and they will have some of the most powerful cards available. So it’s crucial to assemble the toughest squad possible.

 But like always, there is a catch. There’s always a catch.

 As Carl and Donut know all too well, just because someone is captured, it doesn’t mean they have been tamed.

 Her name is Shi Maria. She’s easily the most powerful monster in their area. If they want to survive, they must capture her. But she is no ordinary beast. She’s intelligent. She was once married to a god, a god who is now missing. Her special attack is known to drive one insane. They call her the Bedlam Bride.

 They call it Faction Wars.

 The ninth floor.

 Nine armies, each led by rich and powerful aliens from across the galaxy. Each team has one objective: to capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, and, of course, betrayal ... It all makes for great fun and even greater television.

 After all, none of these powerful aliens really die when they’re playing war.

 Except this time. This time, winner takes all. Those who fall, stay in the ground.

 As the AI continues its rapid decline, Carl and company take advantage of the chaos. For the first time ever, the crawlers are fighting back. They are now one of the nine teams. And this season, there’s a tenth army on the playing field. The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and formed a team of their own.

 For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. Only one of them will be allowed to leave this level.

 If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two.

 This is it.

 This is what they’ve been fighting toward.

 This is war.

 He made it to the top. As CEO of an asteroid mining company, Austin has accomplished everything he ever wanted in business. Now, he needs more. To get away he turns to a fantasy video game.

 Is virtual reality the answer?

 Should he pick, elf, gnome, caster, or swordsman?

 Audible has teamed up with Rolling Stone to produce an uncompromisingly honest Audible Original that honors the life and legacy of the incomparable Aretha Franklin. Aretha’s universal appeal was evident from the release of her first album at age 14 through her nearly 50 Top 40 hits. Yet this intimate biography reminds us that Aretha knew pain as much as she knew glory. It was the blues, residing deep within her soul, that gave way to a voice able to lift millions with a profound sense of freedom, self-worth, and undeniable talent to rise above sorrow.

 Aretha’s unshakeable foundation of faith - fueled by a childhood spent singing in church alongside her famous father, minister C.L. Franklin - allowed her to blend heartbreak with spirituality in soul-stirring song. By diving into the true story of Aretha - from the years following her mother’s passing to the moment she decided to become a singer - the listener can’t help but glimpse the roots of the sorrow behind her famous eyes."><img class="cover" src="covers/Mikal Gilmore/The Queen - Aretha Franklin.jpg" alt="Cover of The Queen - Aretha Franklin" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Queen - Aretha Franklin</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Mikal Gilmore</td><td>Adenrele Ojo</td><td>2018-10-04</td><td>Biographies &amp; Memoirs:Entertainment &amp; Celebrities</td><td>3:48</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Mike Duncan/The Storm Before the Storm.jpg" data-title="The Storm Before the Storm - The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Mike Duncan" data-narrator="Mike Duncan" data-year="2017-10-24" data-genre="History:Ancient:Rome" data-duration="10:13" data-desc="The creator of the award-winning podcast series The History of Rome and Revolutions brings to life the bloody battles, political machinations, and human drama that set the stage for the fall of the Roman Republic.

 The Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. Beginning as a small city-state in central Italy, Rome gradually expanded into a wider world filled with petty tyrants, barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. Through the centuries, Rome&#x27;s model of cooperative and participatory government remained remarkably durable and unmatched in the history of the ancient world.

 In 146 BC, Rome finally emerged as the strongest power in the Mediterranean. But the very success of the Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome now ruled: rising economic inequality disrupted traditional ways of life, endemic social and ethnic prejudice led to clashes over citizenship and voting rights, and rampant corruption and ruthless ambition sparked violent political clashes that cracked the once indestructible foundations of the Republic.

 Chronicling the years 146-78 BC, The Storm Before the Storm dives headlong into the first generation to face this treacherous new political environment. Abandoning the ancient principles of their forbearers, men like Marius, Sulla, and the Gracchi brothers set dangerous new precedents that would start the Republic on the road to destruction and provide a stark warning about what can happen to a civilization that has lost its way."><img class="cover" src="covers/Mike Duncan/The Storm Before the Storm.jpg" alt="Cover of The Storm Before the Storm - The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Storm Before the Storm - The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Mike Duncan</td><td>Mike Duncan</td><td>2017-10-24</td><td>History:Ancient:Rome</td><td>10:13</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Montgomery Quinn/I Summoned My What!, Book 3.jpg" data-title="I Summoned My What?!, Book 3" data-series="I Summoned My What?!" data-index="3" data-author="Montgomery Quinn" data-narrator="Wayne Kelly, Raya Kane" data-year="2024-02-26" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure" data-duration="7:19" data-desc="A succubus.

 Hot on the heels of The Twin, the undisputed queen of YA thrillers is back with a scary and suspenseful read about a summer camp filled with dark secrets.

 Esme and Kayla once were campers at Camp Pine Lake. Now they’re back as counselors-in-training. Esme loves the little girls in her cabin and thinks it’s funny how scared they are of everything - the woods, the bugs, the boys...even swimming in the lake. It reminds her of how she and Kayla used to be. Before...

 Because Esme and Kayla did something terrible when they were campers. Something they’ve kept a secret all these years. They vow that this summer will be awesome. Two months of sun, s’mores, and flirting with the cute boy counselors. But then they get a message:

 The lake never forgets.

 The secret they’ve kept buried for so many years is about to resurface.

 From the viral TikTok author of the stalker romcom, LIGHTS OUT, comes Navessa Allen’s second book in best-selling The Into Darkness Trilogy, upping the ante with voyeurism and play club kink.

 “I wanted this woman, and I was a man who always got what he wanted.”

 Nico &quot;Junior&quot; Trocci knows Lauren Marchetti is off limits. She is sweetness and laughter, whereas Junior exists in a world of violence and depravity. Men like him don’t get to have women like her. It’s why he pushed her away back in high school and kept his distance ever since.

 But when Junior looks Lauren up online, he discovers the shy, bookish girl he remembers is gone. In her place is a strikingly beautiful woman whose social media is filled with scantily clad pictures of herself and a connection to a nearby play club. Junior’s innocent curiosity quickly turns into a dark obsession. Watching Lauren from a distance isn’t enough; he needs to make her his.

 “He’s ruthless; a walking red flag. Good thing red is my favorite color.”

 Lauren is intrigued by the mystery man who keeps showing up at her club, who tempts her white-hot desires. But as their flirty online messages stir up a deeper form of connection, Lauren worries she’s developing real feelings for this brooding stranger.

 This program is read by the author, world-renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

 Bringing his cosmic perspective to civilization on Earth, Neil deGrasse Tyson shines new light on the crucial fault lines of our time—war, politics, religion, truth, beauty, gender, and race—in a way that stimulates a deeper sense of unity for us all.

 In a time when our political and cultural views feel more polarized than ever, Tyson provides a much-needed antidote to so much of what divides us, while making a passionate case for the twin chariots of enlightenment—a cosmic perspective and the rationality of science.

 After thinking deeply about how science sees the world and about Earth as a planet, the human brain has the capacity to reset and recalibrates life’s priorities, shaping the actions we might take in response. No outlook on culture, society, or civilization remains untouched.

 With crystalline prose, Starry Messenger walks us through the scientific palette that sees and paints the world differently. From insights on resolving global conflict to reminders of how precious it is to be alive, Tyson reveals, with warmth and eloquence, an array of brilliant and beautiful truths that apply to us all, informed and enlightened by knowledge of our place in the universe.

Even the Gods themselves are closely monitoring the situation, ready to intervene should they deem it necessary.

 However, though all these entities have different reasons and methods, they all have the same objective - to find the mastermind responsible for setting all this in motion.

 The same &quot;mastermind&quot; that is far too busy figuring out how wagons work to notice the world is stirring.

The former are seen as hardcore traditionalists hell-bent on maintaining the status quo, while the latter only look ever forward and upward as they grasp at the future with both hands. And yet, these two seemingly opposing cultures serve as a counter-balance to each other, creating a civilization that draws upon the wisdom of the past to face new challenges. Whether that is actually the case or mere propaganda will soon to be put to the test, as they are about to receive a visit from the Hero of Chaos. The enigmatic herald of change has already fostered a well-deserved reputation for setting things in motion by their presence, and only time will tell if the Kingdom of the stout-folk will survive the impending transition.

 Though, once again, Boxxy doesn&#x27;t actually care what ripples it causes. It isn&#x27;t there to upset society or challenge the stagnant culture of all-work-no-play. Its goal is to track down an errant treasure that escaped its grasp while it was out of commission, and maybe secure some new pieces for its ever-growing collection along the way. Before it has a chance to, however, it must first deal with a significant issue that threatens to undo much of its work since its arrival in Azurvale. It is a challenge unlike any it has faced, and not one that it can hope to solve easily through force and violence. The limits of Boxxy&#x27;s patience and self-control are about to be tested, as it looks desperately for a way...to leave the house.

War with the Empire to the south is imminent, and there&#x27;s talk of the city&#x27;s adventurers being drafted into the campaign. Though this conflict seems inevitable and promises to be horrific, the common folk can do little but act like there&#x27;s nothing wrong. Rather than lose sleep over something so wildly out of their control, they instead worry about tiny, personal, inconsequential issues. Things like, &quot;Will the butcher have fresh steak today?&quot; and, &quot;Should I get those new boots now, or wait and see if they go on sale?&quot;

 However, though they try to maintain some modicum of normalcy, the people of Azurvale have yet to find out that their capital is already under threat. Not by some warmongering nation, but by a certain individual that has come to them seeking asylum, knowledge, profit, and power through any means necessary. As this newcomer burrows into the city&#x27;s underbelly like a voracious tick, it cares not for the people it hurts along the way. Indeed, any soul unfortunate enough to cross paths with Boxxy T. Morningwood seems doomed to have their life ruined in one way or another. Often through no fault of their own.

 Whether it&#x27;s an ancient being, a skilled assassin, a godlike archer, or a fresh-faced recruit, none shall be spared from the whims of chaos.

That is how history will remember the date when two Overlords clashed amidst the war-torn streets of New Whitehall. The disastrous duel its explosive conclusion wreaked heavy casualties on the two armies present, rendering both the Ishigar Republic and the Lodrak Empire unable to continue to fight. And yet, it was no stalemate. With one Hero defeated and another revealed, the balance of power is sure to shift in the elvish nation’s favor. The Republic’s leaders will surely not hesitate to seize this opportunity, as they had already paid for it in blood and gold. Meanwhile the Lodrak Empire is gripped by unease overnight as their Goddess mysteriously falls silent.

 Boxxy doesn’t care about any of that at the moment. Mostly because the confrontation with Teresa has left it in a comatose state at a most inopportune time. With the Hero status of its public persona revealed, it will be forced to rapidly adapt and escalate its plans. Whereas before it only had to worry about keeping its true identity a secret, it will now have to worry about its alter ego being targeted. Each chosen of the divines is a controversial figure, and the suddenly revealed Hero of Chaos will surely attract a lot of attention.

 And, as the shapeshifter’s primal instincts are well aware, too much attention can and will lead to a surprise meeting with Death itself.

Following the unprecedented outcome of the siege at Fort Yimin, both the Republic and the Empire are forced to drastically reevaluate their plans for the conflict. With matters on the western front more or less settled for the moment, the warring nations turn their attention toward the eastern theatre. Winter looms on the horizon, threatening to deadlock the region and put a temporary halt to hostilities. With both sides planning to deploy bold and unconventional strategies on top of committing vast resources, it’s anyone’s guess which of them will come out on top.

 Indeed, neither government is shying away from resorting to underhanded, questionable, or downright amoral means. The Gilded Hand has been stepping up their efforts to further Spymaster Edward Allen’s schemes. The Empire’s intelligence agency is also looking to field its most powerful enforcers in the coming battles. The Republic’s Foreign Intelligence Bureau is having a hard time keeping up, but they are not without their own dirty tricks. Rumors within the royal palace of the Horkensaft Kingdom to the east suggest that the dwarves and gnomes are on the verge of aiding the elven nation. Something that wouldn’t have been made possible without the Republic’s deep coffers, and the less-than-reputable individuals that fill them.

 Boxxy T. Morningwood isn’t one of those shady contributors. If anything, it’s been steadily draining the government’s resources as it forces them to pay exorbitant fees to resolve issues that the monster itself creates. A trend it plans to keep following for as long as it can lie, cheat, and murder its way through life.

 Which, barring something ridiculous like divine intervention, is poised to be a very long time indeed.

 Things are far less jovial for the one under Tom&#x27;s &quot;care&quot;, however. Stuck in the monster-infested wilderness, lacking the usual backup, hunted by the Empire&#x27;s top brass, and tasked with an incredibly vague and obtuse Quest, Boxxy will face a world of uncertainty and adversity. However, this is nothing new. Pain, suffering, and loss are things that have been commonplace since day one, and Boxxy is not only entirely undaunted, but also eager to share those valuable lessons with its new &quot;companion&quot;. With things both shiny and tasty on the line, the crafty killer has every intention of showing that lich who&#x27;s boss.

 Assuming Boxxy manages to find it, of course.

 In the semifinals, Seth is getting the upper hand when his opponent uses an illegal blow to take him out. Upon waking up from a coma, Seth finds out he&#x27;s lost his sight.

 A stunning novel from the #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts - Year One is an epic of hope and horror, chaos and magick, and a journey that will unite a desperate group of people to fight the battle of their lives...

 It began on New Year’s Eve.

 The sickness came on suddenly, and spread quickly. The fear spread even faster. Within weeks, everything people counted on began to fail them. The electrical grid sputtered; law and government collapsed - and more than half of the world’s population was decimated.

 Where there had been order, there was now chaos. And as the power of science and technology receded, magick rose up in its place. Some of it is good, like the witchcraft worked by Lana Bingham, practicing in the loft apartment she shares with her lover, Max. Some of it is unimaginably evil, and it can lurk anywhere, around a corner, in fetid tunnels beneath the river - or in the ones you know and love the most.

 As word spreads that neither the immune nor the gifted are safe from the authorities who patrol the ravaged streets, and with nothing left to count on but each other, Lana and Max make their way out of a wrecked New York City. At the same time, other travelers are heading west too, into a new frontier. Chuck, a tech genius trying to hack his way through a world gone offline. Arlys, a journalist who has lost her audience but uses pen and paper to record the truth. Fred, her young colleague, possessed of burgeoning abilities and an optimism that seems out of place in this bleak landscape. And Rachel and Jonah, a resourceful doctor and a paramedic who fend off despair with their determination to keep a young mother and three infants in their care alive.

 In a world of survivors where every stranger encountered could be either a savage or a savior, none of them knows exactly where they are heading, or why. But a purpose awaits them that will shape their lives and the lives of all those who remain.

 The end has come. The beginning comes next."><img class="cover" src="covers/Nora Roberts/Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1</td><td>Chronicles of The One</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Nora Roberts</td><td>Julia Whelan</td><td>2017-12-05</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Supernatural</td><td>12:20</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Oliver Mayes/Occultist- Saga Online #1 - A LitRPG series.jpg" data-title="Occultist: Saga Online #1 - A LitRPG series" data-series="Saga Online" data-index="1" data-author="Oliver Mayes" data-narrator="Adam Sims" data-year="2019-02-21" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="15:29" data-desc="Damien thought his exams would be bad enough.

 Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. Jess and Jason, she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.

 Until today.

 And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel goes to the police.

 Marie Sklodowska, 25, is studying science at the Sorbonne—one of the only universities in the world that has begun to admit women. A thousand miles from her native Poland, with no money and the odds stacked against any woman daring to pursue a career in such a rigorous field, Marie throws herself into her studies. She’s certain that to succeed in a man’s world, she will have to go it alone.

 Her meticulous plans get thrown slightly off-course when Marie attracts the attention of an accomplished physicist, himself on the precipice of greatness. Pierre Curie, famous for his work on symmetry, believes he has found in Marie an equal who shares his devotion to scientific discovery. He offers to help with her work, and soon begins to court her. But to Marie, men have always been an obstacle, love a distraction from her goals. She hasn’t come this far to let either stand in the way of her dreams—dreams Pierre insists they can share.

 In A Mind of Her Own, McLain taps into the luminous mind and complex heart of a singular woman caught between order and chaos, science and love in the period just before the world would learn her name."><img class="cover" src="covers/Paula Mclain/A Mind of Her Own.jpg" alt="Cover of A Mind of Her Own" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>A Mind of Her Own</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Paula Mclain</td><td>Hillary Huber</td><td>2019-02-28</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Biographical Fiction</td><td>1:15</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Penn Cole/Glow of the Everflame - The Kindred&#x27;s Curse Saga, Book 2.jpg" data-title="Glow of the Everflame - The Kindred&#x27;s Curse Saga, Book 2" data-series="The Kindred&#x27;s Curse Saga" data-index="2" data-author="Penn Cole" data-narrator="Amanda Dolan" data-year="2024-03-05" data-genre="Romance:Fantasy" data-duration="20:50" data-desc="An unexpected gift offers the power to change everything.

 From the hugely talented author of The Kind Worth Killing comes an exquisitely chilling tale of a young suburban wife with a history of psychological instability whose fears about her new neighbor could lead them both to murder....

 Hen and her husband, Lloyd, have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.

 But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she’s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder - an obsession she doesn’t talk about anymore but can’t fully shake, either.

 Could her neighbor Matthew be a killer? Or is this the beginning of another psychotic episode like the one she suffered back in college, when she became so consumed with proving a fellow student guilty that she ended up hurting a classmate?

 The more Hen observes Matthew, the more she suspects he’s planning something truly terrifying. Yet no one will believe her. Then one night, when she comes face-to-face with Matthew in a dark parking lot, she realizes he knows she’s been watching him, that she’s really on to him; and that this is the beginning of a horrifying nightmare she may not live to escape...."><img class="cover" src="covers/Peter Swanson/Before She Knew Him - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Before She Knew Him - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Before She Knew Him - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Peter Swanson</td><td>Sophie Amoss, Graham Halstead</td><td>2019-03-05</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Literary Fiction</td><td>10:15</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Pierce Brown/Red Rising.jpg" data-title="Red Rising" data-series="Red Rising" data-index="1" data-author="Pierce Brown" data-narrator="Tim Gerard Reynolds" data-year="2014-01-28" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="16:12" data-desc="Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future.

 Sybil Delling has spent nine years dreaming of having no dreams at all. Like the other foundling girls who traded a decade of service for a home in the great cathedral, Sybil is a Diviner. In her dreams she receives visions from six unearthly figures known as Omens. From them, she can predict terrible things before they occur, and lords and common folk alike travel across the kingdom of Traum’s windswept moors to learn their futures by her dreams.

 Just as she and her sister Diviners near the end of their service, a mysterious knight arrives at the cathedral. Rude, heretical, and devilishly handsome, the knight Rodrick has no respect for Sybil&#x27;s visions. But when Sybil&#x27;s fellow Diviners begin to vanish one by one, she has no choice but to seek his help in finding them. For the world outside the cathedral’s cloister is wrought with peril. Only the gods have the answers she is seeking, and as much as she&#x27;d rather avoid Rodrick&#x27;s dark eyes and sharp tongue, only a heretic can defeat a god."><img class="cover" src="covers/Rachel Gillig/The Knight and the Moth.jpg" alt="Cover of The Knight and the Moth" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Knight and the Moth</td><td>Stonewater Kingdom</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Rachel Gillig</td><td>Samantha Hydeson</td><td>2025-05-20</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy</td><td>13:51</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Rachel Gillig/Two Twisted Crowns.jpg" data-title="Two Twisted Crowns" data-series="Shepherd King" data-index="2" data-author="Rachel Gillig" data-narrator="Lisa Cordileone" data-year="2023-10-17" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy" data-duration="14:12" data-desc="In the dark, spellbinding sequel to One Dark Window, Elspeth must confront the weight of her actions as she and Ravyn embark on a perilous quest to save the kingdom—perfect for listeners of Hannah Whitten&#x27;s For the Wolf and Alexis Henderson&#x27;s The Year of the Witching.

The only one who can lead them through is the monster that shares Elspeth’s head: the Nightmare.

 If you have ever said any of these things to yourself...something else will make me happy; I’m not a good mom; I will never get past this; I am defined by my weight; I should be further along by now...then you could benefit from the unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity Rachel Hollis has in store for you. In this challenging but conversational audiobook, Rachel exposes the 20 lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore.

 Rachel is real and talks about real issues. More than that, she reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.

 Alex finds herself on the shore of a distant place - a world unfamiliar.
 A world of fantasy and magic. A world that is a game.

 NPCs and players all insist she is an NPC, a part of the world. A part of the code of the game. A part of the fantasy to entertain the players. She rejects the idea, for her memories can&#x27;t just be lies. Could they?

 Alex sets out to establish herself in the sandbox fantasy world, to find her identity, and to weather the storm between the coming players and the inhabitants of the new world.

 On the litRPG spectrum, this would be considered a soft litRPG. Don&#x27;t expect heavy number crunching!

 The Multiverse Virtual Reality, known as the MWR or MVVR, is a collection of atomic-level simulations that exist as games and research experiments. Instance_ID8092, otherwise known as the Otherworld, is a mysterious new Virtual Reality MMO that was recently revealed in the long list of VRMMOs. As soon as the players found the new game, they dove in to find an entire world thriving with NPCs.

 The world exists as a geographic copy of pre-war Earth with its inhabitants enjoying a pre-industrial level of technology.

He&#x27;s enriched himself, empowered his county with that coin, and built his county ever higher.

 The war swings in favor of his Duchess.

 Yet the war still goes on. The end doesn&#x27;t seem to be near, nor does Alex feel as if it is as simple as he&#x27;d once thought it. Alex would rather settle down in his county and live a quiet and enjoyable life. One filled with familial things and friends. Where he could make his county the pride of the empire in peace.

 Because he&#x27;d already gotten to the top once before. He&#x27;d climbed the corporate ladder in his previous life and missed out on really having one.

 Having friends. Or just a family.

 Now Alex wants only for the simple things. Things that have no place on the battlefield, kingdom politics, or the courts.

 That, of course, doesn&#x27;t matter much when fate is concerned. Or really, everyone else in the empire. They all have their own plans that all seem to run counter to Alex&#x27;s.

 Fortunately, Alex has been preparing. Making changes and building his foundation and seat of power ever higher.

 He&#x27;s empowered the people he relies on and in. His armies are expertly trained and almost overequipped. His treasury is overflowing and ready to be spent.

 Even with all of that, Alex isn&#x27;t sure it&#x27;ll be enough for what he believes is coming.

 Because spring is here. And that means roads will be opening. Passes will be traversable.

 Making it possible for armies to march.

 Which means it&#x27;s time for Alex to get back to work. Because more than ever, he has a lot to lose, including his newborn children. If he wants to keep them safe, he&#x27;s going to have to ride to war once again.

 And end it once and for all, no matter the cost."><img class="cover" src="covers/Randi Darren/Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3</td><td>Fostering Faust</td><td data-sort="3.0">3</td><td>Randi Darren, William D.

 Alex is dead.

 Dead and apparently with a one-way ticket to a place that only the worst of the worst go.

 All for a simple choice he made about a product his company owned.

 Damned for all time.

 Luckily for him, he’s about to be given a chance.

 Another choice to make.

 He can instead return to the land of the living, though his soul would belong to another. Except the world he’s being sent to isn’t the same one he came from. It’s not even a similar period in time, but from something long past in history.

 The dark ages.

 And part of the deal to live again, is to make pacts with others. Pacts that would bind the soul of those who take a deal to the same entity who owns Alex’s soul.

 How much would you give of yourself to live on is an easy question.

 The better question, is how much would you take from others?

 If Alex wants to keep living, to keep his soul from being sent to the darkest corner of hell, he’ll have to ask himself that question.

 Daily.

 Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.

 He had been a door-to-door salesman of sorts. One who peddled wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.

 Except that life is gone now.

 His old business model had been modernized. Email, phone contacts, letters, flyers, business cards, and scheduled consultations.

 Sam was a man trapped in place by his own success. And loving it.

 Additionally, he was also the owner of a private military company that specialized in dealing with criminals or those wanted by a government.

 His goals were simple. Rebuilding his strength, establishing a comfortable life for himself and others, and taking from Jenaphila as much as he could.

 As he works to complete those objectives though, Sam’s going to run up against some of the biggest players in any of the planes. And make enemies out of more than a few.

 Everything is changing faster than Sam would like it to. Heading right toward what might just be the end of the prime plane itself.

 Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.

 He’s a door-to-door salesman, of sorts. One that peddles wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.

 Prices that usually involve a few years of your life, maybe a handful of days, or a single night of pleasure that’ll cost a few hours.

 He’s an incubus that solves problems. Mental, emotional, spiritual, material, and anything and everything in between. Sam can provide an answer and resolution.

 A one-man shop and service provider.

 Or he was. When he had work available to him.

 Unfortunately, he’s been unable to work for quite a while, due to the simple fact that he’s been imprisoned against his will by an old business partner.

 Except something’s changed.

 A portal, a way back to the planes, has opened with his name on it. On the other side isn’t what he wished for nor what he feared.

 Sam’s made the choice to go back and start up his business again. From the ground up. In just a moment he’ll make that leap over and into another plane.

 Little does he know that with that first step he’ll move straight from the known, to the unknown, then to the inadvisable.

He does know a lot more than he did previously, though. He’s in a country called Lamals where men are required to have children, then more often than not, go fight and die. And that’s just how it is.

 Things are at least improving, though. Steve successfully put a stop to the Creep’s advance. He’d buried it under a mountain of broken wall and escaped with his life. Which eliminates one enemy. The creep and its undead.

 Now, he only has to worry about bandits, the military, the country of Lamals, and other people.

 With that problem nearly solved, Steve can worry about problems closer to home. After all, his only true concerns are about his farm and his family. That’s all he really needs. Everyone else are little better than a resource to be utilized.

 Unfortunately, things still aren’t what they seem to be. The messages Steve left himself pointed at something beyond their contents. Now, that &quot;something more&quot; is about to make contact with him. On top of that, the farm is going to hit capacity eventually. Especially if one factored into it that Steve was likely going to have children at some point in the future.

 Family troubles and more problems than he could expect are about to find Steve. Shooting up as if they were trees grown with his over-powered watering can.

 Good thing Steve has his axe. Any problem can be solved with it...with the right application of force.

 He knows more than enough to realize it doesn’t matter at all.

 Now living in what had once been the Creeplands and maintaining a thriving farm there, they are under constant siege from the Creep itself.

 It&#x27;s still better than life in Lamals.

 And that’s just how it is.

 After taking over the Citadel, removing Lynn from her place of power, stopping the Creep’s advance, and starting to take over part of the Creeplands, he was certainly making a difference for himself, humans, and men everywhere.

 But with the problems that were close to home eliminated, he now needs to start working on external threats to his personal world. His Citadel and his two farms.

 Before he had only concerned himself with what was near and dear to him, but he&#x27;d overlooked that others saw him as a resource to be utilized.

 Or eliminated.

 On top of all of that, it’s becoming clear that he’s rapidly reaching the end of his task. A task he doesn’t truly know or understand, but one that he apparently agreed to when he still had all his memories. A task assigned to him by a merciless voice that clearly thinks little of him.

 Family troubles are starting to look like a sweet memory and dream compared to what’s on the horizon for him.

 His path could very well lead to the complete collapse of Lamals. At least, if he has anything to say about it.

 This time around, however, even his axe may not be up to the job and he’ll have to resort to more drastic measures.

 After all, any problem can be solved with the right application of force.

 Even a road to hell paved with good intentions.

 Unfortunately, this isn’t even the strangest part of this new life.

 Hidden inside the farm tools, Steve finds messages. Messages that appear in floating windows in front of him.

 Messages from his past self, telling him that he’d already failed once.

 But he has no idea what he actually failed at. Or how he can succeed this time.

 Beyond all this, and unfortunately for Steve, the world just underwent a radical change. A change that’s going to have Steve fighting the undead, bandits, nature, and even himself. All while the world falls down around him.

 He’s taken a different route and joined a resistance faction to help free humanity to become more than just pets to an alien race.

 Accepting the deal, since being alive is far more beneficial than being dead, Wrench is thrown back into the past to live his life all over again, in whatever way he sees fit—whether it be rejoining the resistance, living as a Fixer and taking a leadership role, or just finding a wife and having kids.

 Or utilizing his newfound superpower to alter anything and everything about his body’s systems to become something completely different.

 Before World War II could reach its conclusion, the world suffered what could only be defined as a cataclysm.

 Now, Yosemite City stands as the gateway between two worlds. The empire of humanity to the west, and the wild wastes to the east.

 Standing at the helm for Yosemite is Vince, a ranger turned city-state ruler. Supporting him in his endeavors is his inner circle.

 Vince has begun to maneuver through the intricacies of ruling. At the same time he must balance his expanding foundation and fend off external threats.

 Thankfully, every single citizen of Yosemite is united to the cause. To make their home, permanent. To dig out their place in the world and make a stand.

 Things are starting to spiral out of control. Almost as quickly as he can put it all back together something else falls apart.

 And with Yosemite rapidly rising into prominence, Vince finds that it really means just putting a bull&#x27;s-eye on your back.

And the ones with power rule.

 Gold. Gold floors, gold walls, gold furniture, gold clothes. In Highbell, in the castle built into the frozen mountains, everything is made of gold. Even me.

 King Midas rescued me. Dug me out of the slums and placed me on a pedestal. I&#x27;m called his precious. His favored. I&#x27;m the woman he Gold-Touched to show everyone that I belong to him. To show how powerful he is. He gave me protection, and I gave him my heart. And even though I don&#x27;t leave the confines of the palace, I&#x27;m safe.

 Until war comes to the kingdom and a deal is struck.

 Suddenly, my trust is broken. My love is challenged, and I realize that everything I thought I knew about Midas might be wrong. Because these bars I&#x27;m kept in, no matter how gilded, are still just a cage.

 But the monsters on the other side might make me wish I&#x27;d never left.

 From bestselling author Raven Kennedy comes the first book in the BookTok hit Plated Prisoner series, perfect for fans of Sarah J Maas and Jennifer L Armentrout.

 King Midas made me the woman I am today. Notorious. Unattainable. His.

 The thing about being confined is that you believe it&#x27;s to keep the bad out...Until you realize it&#x27;s about keeping you in.

 I&#x27;m now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won&#x27;t sit idly by and let myself wither. No, something&#x27;s bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.

 The last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.

 He&#x27;s sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he&#x27;s near? I need to tread carefully, or I risk losing much more than just my freedom.

 Regret and revenge war inside me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.

 Because I won&#x27;t be caught in a cage again. No, this time, it&#x27;ll be me setting the trap. I just hope my heart comes out of this unscathed.

 At the heart of my fear, my worry, there&#x27;s him—Commander Rip. Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.

 Fae.

 The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.

 When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason. I may be out of my cage, but I&#x27;m not free, not even close.

 In the game of kings and armies, I&#x27;m the gilded pawn. The question is, can I outmaneuver them?

 Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells - taken without her knowledge - became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than 60 years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

 Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than 20 years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family - past and present - is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

 Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family - especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences."><img class="cover" src="covers/Rebecca Skloot/The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.jpg" alt="Cover of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Rebecca Skloot</td><td>Cassandra Campbell, Bahni Turpin</td><td>2010-02-02</td><td>Biographies &amp; Memoirs:Cultural &amp; Regional</td><td>12:30</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Rebecca Thorne/A Pirate&#x27;s Life for Tea - Tomes &amp; Tea, Book 2.jpg" data-title="A Pirate&#x27;s Life for Tea - Tomes &amp; Tea, Book 2" data-series="Tomes &amp; Tea" data-index="2" data-author="Rebecca Thorne" data-narrator="Jessica Threet" data-year="2024-10-01" data-genre="LGBTQ+:Romance" data-duration="13:05" data-desc="&quot;A skillful narration of this story, especially its humor, makes this a fun and enjoyable performance&quot;—AudioFile on Can&#x27;t Spell Treason Without Tea

 Bookshops &amp; Bonedust meets Our Flag Means Death in this cozy fantasy on the low seas, where lesbian pirates find out if enemies actually can become lovers!

 Kianthe and Reyna are on the hunt for dragon eggs to save their hometown—but it requires making a deal with Diarn Arlon, lord of the legendary Nacean River. Simply capture the river pirate Serina, who’s been plaguing Arlon&#x27;s supply chains, and bring her in for justice. Easy peasy.

 Begrudgingly, the couple joins forces with Bobbie, one of Arlon’s constables determined to capture the pirate. Except Bobbie and Serina have a more complicated history than anyone realized, and it might jeopardize everything.

 While Kianthe and Reyna watch this relation-shipwreck from afar, it quickly becomes apparent that these disaster lesbians need all the help they can get. Luckily, matchmaking is Reyna’s favorite pastime.

 The dragon eggs may have to wait.

Reyna and Kianthe have no trouble commanding the Realm, running a bookshop, or rescuing baby dragons...but can they save their town from the swarming influx of...tourists?!?

On the night of her kidnapping, all Reyna wanted was a relaxing cup of tea. She didn’t expect to be dropped in a hidden prison cell, but what the hells. She’s flexible.

With appropriate fanfare, Kianthe “rescues” her wife...but Reyna’s actually a terrible damsel in distress. Even worse, Reyna&#x27;s cell was booby trapped with a mysterious alchemy circle. What does a radical alchemist want with the Arcandor’s wife? And why did they think they could get away with this?

While they investigate, another problem surfaces in their hometown. Word of New Leaf Tomes and Tea—and its celebrity owners—has finally spread. Tourists are everywhere, harassing the locals and ruining the charm of Tawney. As their friends struggle with the sudden influx, Kianthe and Reyna have to face a bigger conundrum than rogue alchemists: the fact that closing their bookshop might be the only way to save their town.

Things can’t just be simple, can they?

 In the tradition of Legends &amp; Lattes, comes a cozy fantasy steeped in sapphic romance about one of the Queen’s private guards and a powerful mage who want to open a bookshop and live happily ever after…if only the world would let them.

 All Reyna and Kianthe want is to open a bookshop that serves tea. Worn wooden floors, plants on every table, firelight drifting between the rafters… all complemented by love and good company. Thing is, Reyna works as one of the Queen’s private guards, and Kianthe is the most powerful mage in existence. Leaving their lives isn’t so easy.

 But after an assassin takes Reyna hostage, she decides she’s thoroughly done risking her life for a self-centered queen. Meanwhile, Kianthe has been waiting for a chance to flee responsibility–all the better that her girlfriend is on board. Together, they settle in Tawney, a town nestled in the icy tundra near dragon country, and open the shop of their dreams.

 What follows is a cozy tale of mishaps, mysteries, and a murderous queen throwing the realm’s biggest temper tantrum. In a story brimming with hurt/comfort and quiet fireside conversations, these two women will discover just what they mean to each other… and the world.

 &quot;Suspenseful, sexy, and with incredibly entertaining storytelling, the first in Yarros&#x27; Empyrean series will delight fans of romantic, adventure-filled fantasy.&quot;—Booklist, starred review

 &quot;Fourth Wing will have your heart pounding from beginning to end ... A fantasy like you&#x27;ve never read before.&quot;—Jennifer L. Armentrout, #1 New York Times bestselling author

 Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros.

 Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.

 But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away … because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.

 With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.

 She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.

 Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom’s protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.

 Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die."><img class="cover" src="covers/Rebecca Yarros/Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1</td><td>The Empyrean</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Rebecca Yarros</td><td>Rebecca Soler, Teddy Hamilton</td><td>2023-05-02</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>21:22</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Rebecca Yarros/Iron Flame - Empyrean, Book 2.jpg" data-title="Iron Flame - Empyrean, Book 2" data-series="The Empyrean" data-index="2" data-author="Rebecca Yarros" data-narrator="Rebecca Soler, Teddy Hamilton" data-year="2023-11-07" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic" data-duration="28:17" data-desc="“The first year is when some of us lose our lives. The second year is when the rest of us lose our humanity.&quot; Xaden Riorson

 Everyone expected Violet Sorrengail to die during her first year at Basgiath War College-Violet included. But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.

 Now the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves.

 Although Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.

 But a determination to survive won’t be enough this year. Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.

 The Empyrean series is best enjoyed in order.

 Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it’s impossible to know who to trust.

 Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves—her dragons, her family, her home, and him.

 Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.

 They need an army. They need power. They need magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find—the truth.

 But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath.

 Trian is ready to start training the first generation of Medic Sentinels, the battle-healers of their newly founded organization, and Ilea is happy to join in as a teacher (of sorts). Hopefully, her work will pay off in the birth of at least a few mini-versions of herself.

 By day, Ilea teaches the Sentinels her way of fighting and training (resistances), and by night, she applies the principles to herself. She explores supposedly very dangerous dungeons in the south and exposes herself to all manner of magics and traps, as every increased skill and resistance will help prepare her for the coming of her third class.

 It is a good routine; as long as she has mana to heal, the numbers will go up.

 However, all good grinding sessions must come to an end, the invitation of a powerful order soon pulls her back into the conflicts of humanity and beyond. With new powers and allies, she flies into a kingdom on the losing side of a war and finds things are not quite as they seem...

 Perhaps punching a lot of things really hard will once again prove to be a viable solution.

 Unfortunately, Ilea’s blood-soaked reunions are cut short when she is summoned back to Hallowfort, to help deal with a sinister corruption that is spilling out from the first layer of the Descent.

 Searching for a lost expedition, Ilea explores an ancient dungeon host to long-forgotten secrets. She will be pushed to her limit and face dangers that no one in their right mind would dare to stand against.

 Sounds like fun, right?

And eating.

 Unfortunately, there aren’t too many career options for hungry brawlers. Instead, the plan is to quit her crappy fast-food job, go to college, and become a fully functioning member of society. Essentially—a fate worse than death.

 So maybe it&#x27;s lucky that she wakes up one day in a strange world where a bunch of fantasy monsters are trying to kill her?

 On the bright side, &quot;killing those monsters right back&quot; is now a viable career path! For she soon discovers her new home runs on a set of game-like rules that will allow her to punch things harder than in her wildest dreams. Well, maybe not her wildest dreams, but it’s close.

 With no quest to follow, no guide to show her the way, and no real desire to be a Hero—Ilea embarks on a journey to discover a world full of magic. Magic she can use to fight even bigger monsters.

 She’s struggling to survive, has no idea what will happen next, and is loving every minute of it. Except, and sometimes also, when she’s poisoned and/or has set herself on fire. It’s complicated.

 A friend is in danger, and there is work to be done.

 The trail leads Ilea to the Empire and beyond, to dark alleys and ancient dungeons, to unknown desolate lands beyond the frontiers of humanity, and to the ruins of a long-forgotten Kingdom.

 There are old allies to fight with and new ones to be made; an excellent maker of cakes, a fiery fox with a sweet tooth, and an… unlikely historian. Ilea will need all the help and levels she can get, to beat down both beast and man (and occasionally the weather too), for her enemies are many, and not every fight will be as simple as just another Drake.

 A long journey is just beginning, and she may be surprised where it ends. Hopefully, there is some good food along the way…

 While Elizabeth wrestles with her conscience (and a gun), Joyce, Ron, and Ibrahim chase down the clues with help from old friends and new. But can the gang solve the mystery and save Elizabeth before the murderer strikes again?

 From an upmarket spa to a prison cell complete with espresso machine to a luxury penthouse high in the sky, this third adventure of the Thursday Murder Club is full of the cleverness, intrigue, and irresistible charm that readers have come to expect from Richard Osman’s bestselling series.

 Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim—the Thursday Murder Club—are still riding high off their recent real-life murder case and are looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet at Cooper’s Chase, their posh retirement village.

 But they are out of luck.

 An unexpected visitor—an old pal of Elizabeth’s (or perhaps more than just a pal?)—arrives, desperate for her help. He has been accused of stealing diamonds worth millions from the wrong men and he’s seriously on the lam.

 Then, as night follows day, the first body is found. But not the last. Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim are up against a ruthless murderer who wouldn’t bat an eyelid at knocking off four septuagenarians. Can our four friends catch the killer before the killer catches them? And if they find the diamonds, too? Well, wouldn’t that be a bonus? You should never put anything beyond the Thursday Murder Club.

 The Thursday Murder Club

 In a peaceful retirement village, four unlikely friends meet weekly in the Jigsaw Room to discuss unsolved crimes; together, they call themselves the Thursday Murder Club.

 When a local developer is found dead with a mysterious photograph left next to the body, the Thursday Murder Club suddenly find themselves in the middle of their first live case.

 As the bodies begin to pile up, can our unorthodox but brilliant gang catch the killer, before it&#x27;s too late?"><img class="cover" src="covers/Richard Osman/The Thursday Murder Club - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of The Thursday Murder Club - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Thursday Murder Club - A Novel</td><td>A Thursday Murder Club Mystery</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Richard Osman</td><td>Lesley Manville</td><td>2020-09-22</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Mystery:Amateur Sleuths</td><td>12:26</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Richard Rhodes/The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition.jpg" data-title="The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition" data-series="Richard Rhodes&#x27; Nuclear Histories" data-index="" data-author="Richard Rhodes" data-narrator="Holter Graham" data-year="2016-02-09" data-genre="History:Americas:United States" data-duration="37:16" data-desc="Here for the first time, in rich human, political, and scientific detail, is the complete story of how the bomb was developed, from the turn-of-the-century discovery of the vast energy locked inside the atom to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan.

 Few great discoveries have evolved so swiftly - or have been so misunderstood. From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity, there was a span of hardly more than 25 years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project and then into the bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers - Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann - stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.

 Richard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man&#x27;s most awesome discovery and invention. The Making of the Atomic Bomb has been compared in its sweep and importance to William L. Shirer&#x27;s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It is at once a narrative tour de force and a document as powerful as its subject."><img class="cover" src="covers/Richard Rhodes/The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition.jpg" alt="Cover of The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition</td><td>Richard Rhodes&#x27; Nuclear Histories</td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Richard Rhodes</td><td>Holter Graham</td><td>2016-02-09</td><td>History:Americas:United States</td><td>37:16</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Rick Riordan/From the World of Percy Jackson- Sun and the Star.jpg" data-title="From the World of Percy Jackson: Sun and the Star - A Nico di Angelo Adventure" data-series="From the World of Percy Jackson" data-index="Sun and" data-author="Rick Riordan, Mark Oshiro" data-narrator="A.j.

 Percy Jackson fans, rejoice! Nico and Will have a book of their own!

 As the son of Hades, Nico di Angelo has been through so much, from the premature deaths of his mother and sister, to being outed against his will, to losing his friend Jason during the trials of Apollo. But there is a ray of sunshine in his life—literally: his boyfriend, Will Solace, the son of Apollo. Together the two demigods can overcome any obstacle or foe. At least, that&#x27;s been the case so far . . .

 Now Nico is being plagued by a voice calling out to him from Tartarus, the lowest part of the Underworld. He thinks he knows who it is: a reformed Titan named Bob whom Percy and Annabeth had to leave behind when they escaped Hades&#x27;s realm. Nico&#x27;s dreams and Rachel Dare&#x27;s latest prophecy leave little doubt in Nico&#x27;s mind that Bob is in some kind of trouble. Nico has to go on this quest, whether Mr. D and Chiron like it or not. And of course Will insists on coming with. But can a being made of light survive in the darkest part of the world? And what does the prophecy mean that Nico will have to &quot;leave something of equal value behind?&quot;

 Nico will have to face demons both internal and external as his relationship with Will is tested to the core in this standalone adventure featuring two of the most popular characters in the Percy Jackson saga.

 Rick Riordan’s newest Percy Jackson adventure is full of hilarious set pieces, a diverse cast of gods and monsters, and many other delightful tricks and treats. Percy Jackson, now a high school senior, needs three recommendation letters from the Greek gods in order to get into New Rome University. He earned his first one by retrieving Ganymede’s chalice. Now the goddess Hecate has offered Percy another “opportunity”—all he has to do is pet sit her polecat, Gale, and mastiff, Hecuba, over Halloween week while she is away. Piece of cake, right?

 Percy, Annabeth, and Grover settle into Hecate’s seemingly endless mansion and start getting acquainted with the fussy, terrifying animals. The trio has been warned not to touch anything, but while Percy and Annabeth are out at school, Grover can’t resist drinking a strawberry-flavored potion in the laboratory.

 Ryan&#x27;s life sucks.

 His brother is a jerk, his mom is sick, and his legs are next to useless thanks to a neurological disorder. Plus the world ended two centuries ago from nuclear war. Now, what&#x27;s left of humanity live below ground, with the only escape from reality being the massive VR world of Crystal Shards Online.

 But even in the game, Ryan&#x27;s life sucks. Unable to play a combat class due to his condition, he works as a miner, earning barely enough to get by and not nearly enough to afford the operation that will save his mom&#x27;s life.

 When Ryan discovers an item that grants the ability to dodge any attack, however, he has the chance to become one of the game world&#x27;s most elite and sought after players: a Dodge Tank.

 “A superb suspense writer…Brava, Ruth Ware. I daresay even Henry James would be impressed.” (Maureen Corrigan, author of So We Read On)

 “This appropriately twisty Turn of the Screw update finds the Woman in Cabin 10 author in her most menacing mode, unfurling a shocking saga of murder and deception.” (Entertainment Weekly)

 From the number one New York Times best-selling author of The Lying Game and The Death of Mrs. Westaway comes this thrilling novel that explores the dark side of technology.

 When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely.

 But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss - a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten - by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.

 What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare - one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.

 Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the home&#x27;s cameras, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman.

 It was everything.

 She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty - at least not of murder - but somebody is. Which means someone else is.

 Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, The Turn of the Key is an pause-resisting thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time."><img class="cover" src="covers/Ruth Ware/The Turn of the Key.jpg" alt="Cover of The Turn of the Key" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Turn of the Key</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Ruth Ware</td><td>Imogen Church</td><td>2019-08-06</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Literary Fiction</td><td>12:13</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Ryan Debruyn/Equalize- A Post-Apocalyptic LitRPG - Ether Collapse, Book 1.jpg" data-title="Equalize: A Post-Apocalyptic LitRPG - Ether Collapse, Book 1" data-series="Ether Collapse" data-index="1" data-author="Ryan Debruyn" data-narrator="Luke Daniels" data-year="2019-06-27" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Paranormal &amp; Urban:Contemporary" data-duration="15:31" data-desc="Gaia has awakened, and the world will never be the same again

 Introducing Audible&#x27;s Thriller of the Year: Silent Child by Sarah A. Denzil, performed by Joanne Froggatt.

 In the summer of 2006, Emma Price watched helplessly as her six-year-old son&#x27;s red coat was fished out of the River Ouse. It was the tragic story of the year - a little boy, Aiden, wandered away from school during a terrible flood, fell into the river, and drowned. His body was never recovered. Ten years later Emma has finally rediscovered the joy in life. She&#x27;s married, pregnant, and in control again...until Aiden returns.

 Too traumatised to speak, he raises endless questions and answers none. Where has he been? What happened to him on that rainy afternoon? And now that he&#x27;s back, whom can he trust?

 At Audible we love listening to crime books. But every so often one comes along that we think is truly special. An Amazon Kindle number one best-seller, Sarah A. Denzil&#x27;s Silent Child is taking Audible HQ by storm. In an Audible Exclusive production, Joanne Froggatt (Mrs Bates, Downton Abbey) delivers a powerhouse performance that will keep you gripped until the very last second."><img class="cover" src="covers/Sarah A.

 The bestselling phenomenon, When the Moon Hatched, is a fast-paced fantasy romance featuring an immersive, vibrant world with mysterious creatures, a unique magic system, and a love that blazes through the ages.

 The Creators did not expect their beloved dragons to sail skyward upon their end. To curl into balls just beyond gravity’s grip, littering the sky with tombstones. With moons. They certainly did not expect them to FALL.

 As an assassin for the rebellion group Fíur du Ath, Raeve’s job is to complete orders and never get caught. When a rival bounty hunter turns her world upside down, blood spills, hearts break, and Raeve finds herself imprisoned by the Guild of Nobles—a group of powerful fae who turn her into a political statement.

 Crushed by the loss of his great love, Kaan Vaegor took the head of a king and donned his melted crown. Now on a tireless quest to quell the never-ebbing ache in his chest, he is lured by a clue into the capitol’s high-security prison where he stumbles upon the imprisoned Raeve....

 Echoes of the past race between them.

 There’s more to their story than meets the eye, but some truths are too poisonous to swallow.

 &quot;&quot;A wild ride that thrills as much as it enchants . . . This remarkable book is an instant classic.” — Thea Guanzon, New York Times bestselling author of The Hurricane Wars

 “When The Moon Hatched breathes new, beautiful life into the genre, as Sarah A. Parker weaves lyrical prose with undeniable chemistry. I laughed, I cried, I got everything out of this. It’s an absolutely stunning fantasy world that everyone should sink their teeth into.” — Raven Kennedy, internationally bestselling author of The Plated Prisoner series

 Feyre, Rhysand, and their friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly altered world beyond, recovering from the war that changed everything. But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.

 Yet even the festive atmosphere can&#x27;t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.

 A Court of Frost and Starlight explores the far-reaching effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.

Maas&#x27;s sexy, richly imagined audio experience continues with the journey of Feyre&#x27;s fiery sister, Nesta.

 Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she&#x27;s struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can&#x27;t seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.

 The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre&#x27;s Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta&#x27;s orbit. But her temper isn&#x27;t the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.

 Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.

 Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing—in each other&#x27;s arms.

 Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become the King’s Champion. But she is far from loyal to the crown. Though she goes to great lengths to hide her secret, her deadly charade becomes more difficult when she realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. Her search for answers ensnares those closest to her, and no one is safe from suspicion—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a princess with a rebel heart.

 Then, one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena’s world shatters, she will be forced to decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie . . . and what she is willing to fight for.

 Enter the world of Throne of Glass with the first book in the #1 bestselling series by Sarah J. Maas.

 In a land without magic, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She has no love for the vicious king who rules from his throne of glass, but she has not come to kill him. She has come to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three murderers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she will be released from prison to serve as the King’s Champion.

 Her name is Celaena Sardothien.

 The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. And a princess from a faraway country will befriend her. But something rotten dwells in the castle, and it’s there to kill. When her competitors start dying mysteriously, one by one, Celaena’s fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival—and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.

 “A gripping inheritance drama, wrapped around a swoony summer romance.”—The New York Times Book Review

 Alice Storm hasn’t been welcome at her family’s magnificent private island off the Rhode Island coast in five years—not since she was cast out and built her life beyond the Storm name, influence, and untold billions. But the shocking death of her larger-than-life father changes everything.

 Alice plans to keep her head down, pay her final respects (such as they are), and leave the minute the funeral is over. Unfortunately, her father had other plans. The eccentric, manipulative patriarch left his family a final challenge—an inheritance game designed to upend their world. The rules are clear: spend one week on the island, complete their assigned tasks, and receive the inheritance.

 But a whole week on Storm Island is no easy task for Alice. Every corner of the sprawling old house is bursting with chaos: Her older sister’s secret love affair. Her brother’s unyielding arrogance. Her younger sister’s constant analysis of the vibes. Her mother’s cold judgment. And all under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father’s intriguing and too-handsome second-in-command. It will be a miracle if Alice manages to escape unscathed.

 A smart and tender story about the transformative power of grief, love, and family, this luscious novel explores past secrets, present truths, and futures forged in the wake of wild summer storms."><img class="cover" src="covers/Sarah Maclean/These Summer Storms - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of These Summer Storms - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>These Summer Storms - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Sarah Maclean</td><td>Julia Whelan</td><td>2025-07-08</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Family Life</td><td>13:17</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Sarah Pinborough/Behind Her Eyes - A Novel.jpg" data-title="Behind Her Eyes - A Novel" data-series="" data-index="" data-author="Sarah Pinborough" data-narrator="Anna Bentinck, Josie Dunn, Bea Holland, Huw Parmenter" data-year="2017-01-31" data-genre="Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Domestic Thrillers" data-duration="11:48" data-desc="SOON TO BE A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

 &quot;An eerie thriller…Pinborough keeps us guessing about just who’s manipulating whom–until the ending reveals that we’ve been wholly complicit in this terrifying mind game.”—The New York Times Book Review

 Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough&#x27;s Behind Her Eyes?

 Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she’s thrilled she finally connected with someone.

 When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar…who says the kiss was a terrible mistake, but who still can’t keep his eyes off Louise.

 And then Louise bumps into Adele, who’s new to town and in need of a friend. But she also just happens to be married to David. And if you think you know where this story is going, think again, because Behind Her Eyes is like no other book you’ve heard before.

 David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife. But then why is David so controlling? And why is Adele so scared of him?

 As Louise is drawn into David and Adele’s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong. But Louise can’t guess how wrong—and how far a person might go to protect their marriage’s secrets.

 In Behind Her Eyes, Sarah Pinborough has written a novel that takes the modern day love triangle and not only turns it on its head, but completely reinvents it in a way that will leave listeners reeling."><img class="cover" src="covers/Sarah Pinborough/Behind Her Eyes - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Behind Her Eyes - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Behind Her Eyes - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Sarah Pinborough</td><td>Anna Bentinck, Josie Dunn, Bea Holland, Huw Parmenter</td><td>2017-01-31</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Domestic Thrillers</td><td>11:48</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Sariah Wilson/Royal Valentine - The Improbable Meet-Cute Collection.jpg" data-title="Royal Valentine - The Improbable Meet-Cute Collection" data-series="The Improbable Meet-Cute collection" data-index="" data-author="Sariah Wilson" data-narrator="Jesse Vilinsky" data-year="2024-01-23" data-genre="Romance:Clean &amp; Wholesome" data-duration="2:01" data-desc="Valentine’s Day becomes a Roman holiday for a princess in disguise in a dizzyingly romantic short story about making wishes come true by the USA Today bestselling author of The Chemistry of Love.

In this case, it was looking to be enough of them to fill an entire calendar.

 It seemed the unthinkable had happened. Someone had actually targeted the Ghalian, an order of assassins known and feared across the systems. It was madness. Only a fool would go after the likes of them. But, it seemed, the galaxy had no shortage of fools.

 Retaliation most bloody was in order, and one man stood ready to spring into action. Hozark was his name, and he was no ordinary man. He was a Master Ghalian, an assassin skilled in the ways of death. Practical, mechanical, magical, to him it made no difference. One way or another, he would get to the bottom of the attack and turn the tables on whoever dared strike out at his brothers and sisters.

 Or so he thought until someone quite unexpected reared their head. An appearance that gave him pause. Someone he had thought long dead. His former lover. A revelation like that could throw even a master assassin for a loop. That she too was an assassin only complicated things more.

 There was far more at play than was apparent on the surface, and Hozark would require all of his wits and skill to get to the bottom of it. And he most surely intended to do just that, no matter how high the body count. He just hoped to do so before more of his kin fell victim to the nefarious plot.

 A sci-fantasy adventure across space, with magic, starships, sword battles, treachery, deadly beasts, and, of course, a healthy dose of snark and sarcasm."><img class="cover" src="covers/Scott Baron/Space Assassins Box Set- The Complete Series, Books 1-5.jpg" alt="Cover of Space Assassins Box Set: The Complete Series, Books 1-5" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Space Assassins Box Set: The Complete Series, Books 1-5</td><td>Space Assassins</td><td data-sort="1.0">1-5</td><td>Scott Baron</td><td>Eric Bryan Moore</td><td>2022-07-15</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Sword &amp; Sorcery</td><td>44:50</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Scott Baron/The Complete Clockwork Chimera Saga- Books 1-5.jpg" data-title="The Complete Clockwork Chimera Saga: Books 1-5 - The Clockwork Chimera, Book 6" data-series="The Clockwork Chimera" data-index="1-5" data-author="Scott Baron" data-narrator="Vivienne Leheny" data-year="2022-11-01" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Post-Apocalyptic" data-duration="53:44" data-desc="Yanked from cryo to join a crew of modded humans in deep space? Daisy&#x27;s life just got a whole lot more complicated.

 As if nearly burning up in a freak accident on her way to Earth wasn&#x27;t bad enough, Daisy had a whole mess of other trouble on her plate. Big trouble. And she was going to get to the bottom of it if it was the last thing she&#x27;d do, which it was starting to look like it very well might be.

 The thing is, Daisy had a simple rule for space travel. Don&#x27;t blow up, and so far she&#x27;d been managing to abide by that, but mere survival wasn&#x27;t enough.

 With the powerful AI supercomputer guiding the craft beginning to show some disconcerting quirks of its own, and its unsettling cyborg assistant nosing into her affairs, Daisy&#x27;s unease was rapidly growing, as was her bigotry toward artificially intelligent beings. Add to the mix a crew of mechanically enhanced humans, any one of whom she suspected might not be what they seemed, and Daisy found herself with a sense of pending dread tickling the periphery of her mind.

 Something was very much not right, she could feel it in her bones. The tricky part now was going to be overcoming her biases and figuring out what the threat was, before it could manifest from a mere sinking feeling in her gut into a potentially deadly reality. Only things were quite different and much worse than she could ever have imagined, forcing her to repeatedly adjust and overcome a reality that turned out to be far from what it had originally seemed. And it was looking like Daisy wouldn&#x27;t have to save only herself, but the entire planet Earth in the process.

 Martin Banks is just a normal guy who has made an abnormal discovery: he can manipulate reality, thanks to reality being nothing more than a computer program. With every use of this ability, though, Martin finds his little “tweaks” have not escaped notice. Rather than face prosecution, he decides instead to travel back in time to the Middle Ages and pose as a wizard.

 An American hacker in King Arthur’s court, Martin must now train to become a full-fledged master of his powers, discover the truth behind the ancient wizard Merlin…and not, y’know, die or anything."><img class="cover" src="covers/Scott Meyer/Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1</td><td>Magic 2.0</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Scott Meyer</td><td>Luke Daniels</td><td>2014-03-18</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy</td><td>10:45</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Sean Oswald/Collapse - Welcome to the Multiverse, Book 3.jpg" data-title="Collapse - Welcome to the Multiverse, Book 3" data-series="Welcome to the Multiverse" data-index="3" data-author="Sean Oswald" data-narrator="Travis Baldree" data-year="2024-07-30" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure" data-duration="12:51" data-desc="Something always goes sideways, but this is bigger than expected.

 He still couldn&#x27;t tell anyone who wasn&#x27;t inducted about the system. It was time to get creative. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, though, he still had the wild hunt hanging over his head. Seven days to go, and then he&#x27;d be thrown into whatever twisted event the system had cooked up for him. The only good thing was that he had those seven days to train.

 Embarking on a rigorous training regimen under the guidance of a seasoned mentor, Silas hones his skills, spells, and crafting abilities alongside allies, old and new. Yet, as his prowess grows, so too does the scope of his challenges.

 Drawn into ancient feuds that span clans and corporations, Silas must navigate a treacherous web of alliances and enmities. His journey takes him beyond the familiar confines of Galen, his adopted sanctuary, thrusting him into the heart of cosmic conflicts that have raged for millennia.

 Elaine finds a small measure of comfort in Serondes&#x27;s arms, experimenting with her first relationship. Experimenting with granting others Immortality.

 In the magical world of Pallos, Elaine can finally breathe for a moment after the horrors of the Han Civil War. Engaged to the love of her life, Iona, Elaine believes she has found peace. However, the tranquility is shattered when three formidable phoenixes descend from the Phoenix Peaks, claiming Auri must go with them for her own good. With heavy hearts, Elaine and Iona watch as Auri disappears into the sky, bound by a promise to return.

 War is brewing in the background, as civilization moves firmly into the crystalized era, where the easy expansion of nations and Immortals start to bump into each other, interests colliding. The wilderness is beaten back, and the era of easy expansion is coming to an end.

 As days melt into weeks, Elaine refuses to stay idle. She makes new divine friends, finally coming into contact with the Goddess of Healing. She immerses herself in the arcane arts at the revered Jakhong Monastery and delves deeper into magic at the School of Sorcery and Spellcraft, her powers growing as rapidly as her concern for Auri. When the agreed timeline expires without a sign of Auri, Elaine&#x27;s worry transforms into resolve. Armed with newly honed wizardry skills and a heart full of determination, the Eventide Eclipse sets out on a perilous journey to the Phoenix Peaks to uncover the truth and bring Auri home.

 What mysteries await Elaine at the Phoenix Peaks? Why has Auri not returned?

 Immortality. The chance to live forever.

 Elaine and Iona have graduated from the School of Sorcery and Spellcraft and are out to try and find her old immortal mentor, Night. Travel isn&#x27;t easy. Different cultures have different ideas of travelers. Plagues and Pekari stalk the Eventide Eclipse. And Night has never been the easiest to find, even when they knew where he was.

 Amina al-Sirafi should be content. After a storied and scandalous career as one of the Indian Ocean’s most notorious pirates, she’s survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon to retire peacefully with her family to a life of piety, motherhood, and absolutely nothing that hints of the supernatural.

 But when she’s tracked down by the obscenely wealthy mother of a former crewman, she’s offered a job no bandit could refuse: retrieve her comrade’s kidnapped daughter for a kingly sum. The chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her family’s future forever? It seems like such an obvious choice that it must be God’s will.

 Yet the deeper Amina dives, the more it becomes alarmingly clear there’s more to this job, and the girl’s disappearance, than she was led to believe. For there’s always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, to savor just a bit more power…and the price might be your very soul.

 Another thrilling domestic suspense novel from the New York Times bestselling author of Not a Happy Family

 “The twists come as fast [as] you can turn the pages.”—People

 “I read this novel at one sitting, absolutely riveted by the storyline. The suspense was beautifully rendered and unrelenting!”—Sue Grafton

 It all started at a dinner party. . .

 A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors—a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .

 Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all—a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night, when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately lands on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.

 Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they&#x27;ve kept for years.

 What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family—a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist."><img class="cover" src="covers/Shari Lapena/The Couple Next Door - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of The Couple Next Door - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Couple Next Door - A Novel</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Shari Lapena</td><td>Kirsten Potter</td><td>2016-08-23</td><td>Literature &amp; Fiction:Genre Fiction:Literary Fiction</td><td>8:40</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Shemer Kuznits/Life Reset- A LitRPG Novel - New Era Online, Book 1.jpg" data-title="Life Reset: A LitRPG Novel - New Era Online, Book 1" data-series="New Era Online" data-index="1" data-author="Shemer Kuznits" data-narrator="Jeff Hays" data-year="2017-10-16" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Cyberpunk" data-duration="24:40" data-desc="The best selling six-books series is now complete!

 Oren, a high-level guild master, wakes in the body of a lowly goblin. Cast out, betrayed by his most trusted advisors, Oren is stuck in New Era Online. However, there are advantages to being on the monsters’ side. Starting from scratch, he’ll have to build up a powerful monster clan to take revenge. But first, he&#x27;ll have to survive long enough not to be someone else&#x27;s fodder.

 Life Reset is the first book in the bestselling fantasy LitRPG series that follows a monster main character who wields darkness-based magic. Includes heavy elements of town-building, raising a monster clan, magic, powerful enemies, and asking the deep existential questions of what it means to be alive inside a digital reality.

Jason&#x27;s actions during the battle have brought unwelcome attention from allies and enemies alike. While the adventurers question his loyalty, the messengers question his very nature. Both have designs on Jason that he intends to thwart, but a danger comes to light that shifts everyone&#x27;s agenda.

 Deep underground, a hidden civilization has survived by tapping into a long-buried power. That power&#x27;s growing instability has become both a threat and an opportunity to the warring surface factions. Neither side can stop or claim the power alone, leading to an uneasy alliance with a reluctant Jason at the center. The adventurers, messengers, and Jason himself all have intentions for the power but little idea what awaits them below ground. There are more players involved than any of them realize, and soon, they will have greater problems than each other.

 To have any chance against the enemies waiting for him, Jason will have to confront the power inside himself that he’s been unwilling to face, fearful of what he’ll become.

 He was promised a life of wandering his new home and having adventures, but things got out of hand pretty quickly. He met with kings and gods, fought interdimensional cults, and got in a knife fight with the guy who creates universes. He didn&#x27;t win. What he&#x27;d never done was roam around, having nice, sensible adventures. He hadn&#x27;t even seen the hometown of his friends, and that had been the first destination on his list.

 Two decades on, he&#x27;d saved whole civilizations and the Earth, several times. He was freshly returned from a conflict with the fate of the cosmos at stake, where the battlefield was his soul and the combatants were the governing forces of reality. It was a fight he had no chance of winning, which was why he rigged it and pinched the prize while everyone was distracted.

 Now, Jason is determined to reunite with his friends and have the simple adventuring life he always wanted. He won&#x27;t let anyone get in his way, not angelic armies, scheming guilds, or the people who want to talk about that time he altered the fundamental laws of magic. Which isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds, he promises.

 Jason&#x27;s taking a gap year, whatever he has to do to make it happen. Manipulate a prestigious noble house into liberating a slave town. Attempt to extort every government on the planet. Blow up and subsequently rebuild the occasional city. Gods help anyone who tries to stop him, but the gods probably won&#x27;t because they&#x27;ve met Jason and they know how that usually goes.

 Jason wakes up in a mysterious world of magic and monsters.

 It’s not easy making the career jump from office-supplies-store middle manager to heroic interdimensional adventurer. At least, Jason tries to be heroic, but it&#x27;s hard to be good when all your powers are evil.

 He’ll face off against cannibals, cultists, wizards, monsters...and that’s just on the first day. He’s going to need courage, he’s going to need wit, and he’s going to need some magic powers of his own. But first, he’s going to need pants.

 Worse, his only weapon is a magical branding iron, which seems to have one skill and one skill only, to overwrite slave brands. Thing is, monster girls seem pretty grateful about being freed from the tyranny of their masters, and with each one he brands, the stronger he becomes.

 And that&#x27;s a good thing because in a world under siege, William and his magical branding iron might be the only thing that stands between them and complete annihilation.

 A brand-new audio event set in the Audible and New York Times best-selling Alliances universe of legendary creator Stan Lee, performed by fan favorite Wil Wheaton.

 Biohacker Olivia Park is obsessed with an emerging mystery within Oz, the online portal created by alien technology. What she finds is a primitive xenobot, Eno, who takes her on a mind-bending trip through time that begins as the Berlin Wall is falling, and takes her back to the origins of the modern internet and the fall of a digital Atlantis created by her father, Wesley Park, and entrepreneur William Ackerson.

 A New Reality expands Stan Lee’s final science fiction universe in new and unexpected ways, exploring the early global computing boom of the 1990s through the eyes of two well-meaning visionaries whose innovations introduce the world to the promise, power, and perils of connectivity - and whose original sins could destroy it all."><img class="cover" src="covers/Stan Lee/Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances- A New Reality.jpg" alt="Cover of Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances: A New Reality" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances: A New Reality</td><td>Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances</td><td data-sort="2.0">2</td><td>Stan Lee, Kat Rosenfield, Created By Stan Lee, Luke Lieberman, Ryan Silbert</td><td>Wil Wheaton</td><td>2021-07-08</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction:Hard Science Fiction</td><td>4:21</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Stan Lee/Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances- A Trick of Light.jpg" data-title="Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances: A Trick of Light" data-series="Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances" data-index="1" data-author="Stan Lee, Kat Rosenfield, Created By Stan Lee, Luke Lieberman, Ryan Silbert" data-narrator="Yara Shahidi" data-year="2019-06-27" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Science Fiction" data-duration="11:48" data-desc="&quot;Leave it to Stan Lee to save his very best for last.

 &quot;Beguiling, cinematic, operatic, A Trick of Light is a bracing espresso first thing in the morning and the thrum of a familiar love deep at night.&quot; (Gary Shteyngart)

 In one of Stan Lee’s final collaborations and most innovative works, the legendary creator invites you to unleash the power of your imagination, and bring to life an epic, superhero origin story set within a tech-centric, highly connected world, unnervingly reminiscent of our own.

 Narrated by Yara Shahidi, one of today’s brightest talents, Stan Lee’s Alliances: A Trick of Light introduces listeners to a mysterious young woman, Nia, whose fate is intertwined with a seemingly ordinary Midwestern teenager, Cameron Ackerson, whose quest for YouTube stardom takes him to the heart of the Great Lakes Triangle where he is imbued with the power to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot; a new reality.

 As Nia and Cameron’s relationship grows, they conspire to create a more righteous online universe, but wind up crossing a shadowy outfit called OPTIC. Meanwhile, a threat of galactic proportions emerges, imperiling humanity’s very existence by harnessing our individual desire to connect as the very means to destroy us.

 Can Nia, Cameron, and Juaquo (Cameron’s best friend) save us from our own collective ruin?

 Elle is a survivor. She’s managed to piece together a solid life from a childhood of broken memories and fairy tales her mom told her to explain away bad dreams. But weekly visits to her mother still fill Elle with a paralyzing fear she can’t explain. It’s just another of so many unanswered questions she grew up with in a family estranged by silence and secrets.

 Elle’s world turns upside down when she receives a deathbed request from her grandfather, a man she was told had died years ago.

 Welcome, welcome to Caraval - Stephanie Garber&#x27;s sweeping tale of two sisters who escape their ruthless father when they enter the dangerous intrigue of a legendary game.

 Scarlett has never left the tiny island where she and her beloved sister, Tella, live with their powerful - and cruel - father. Now Scarlett&#x27;s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval, the faraway once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show, are over.

 But this year Scarlett&#x27;s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval&#x27;s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season&#x27;s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.

 Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. But she nevertheless becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic with the other players in the game. And whether Caraval is real or not, she must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over, a dangerous domino effect of consequences is set off, and her sister disappears forever."><img class="cover" src="covers/Stephanie Garber/Caraval.jpg" alt="Cover of Caraval" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Caraval</td><td>Caraval</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Stephanie Garber</td><td>Rebecca Soler</td><td>2017-01-31</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Family &amp; Relationships:Family</td><td>10:06</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Stephen Fry/Ghost Stories- Stephen Fry&#x27;s Definitive Collection.jpg" data-title="Ghost Stories: Stephen Fry&#x27;s Definitive Collection" data-series="Ghost Stories" data-index="Stephen Fry" data-author="Stephen Fry, Washington Irving, M.r.

 Master storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this #1 New York Times bestselling and spellbinding novel about a young man who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours.

 Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a horrific accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from that shed.

 Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world."><img class="cover" src="covers/Stephen King/Fairy Tale.jpg" alt="Cover of Fairy Tale" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Fairy Tale</td><td></td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Stephen King</td><td>Seth Numrich, Stephen King</td><td>2022-09-06</td><td>Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense:Thriller &amp; Suspense:Supernatural</td><td>24:06</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Stephen King/The Talisman.jpg" data-title="The Talisman" data-series="Jack Sawyer" data-index="1" data-author="Stephen King, Peter Straub" data-narrator="Frank Muller" data-year="2012-11-06" data-genre="Literature &amp; Fiction:Horror:Occult" data-duration="28:00" data-desc="On a brisk autumn day, a 13-year-old boy stands on the shores of the gray Atlantic, near a silent amusement park and a fading ocean resort called the Alhambra.

 Marianne has a life others dream of. A beautiful townhouse on the best street in the neighbourhood. Three bright children who are her pride and joy.

 Sometimes her past still hurts: losing her mother early, growing up in foster care. But her husband, Simon, is always there. A successful surgeon, he’s the envy of every woman they’ve ever met. Flowers, gifts, trips to France: nothing is too good for his family.

 Then Simon says another woman’s name. The way he lingers on it, Caroline, gives Marianne a shudder of suspicion, but she knows it’s nothing - she can’t entertain this flash of paranoia.

 In the old days, she’d have distracted herself by excelling at work, but Marianne left her glamorous career when she married. She’d speak to a friend, but she’s too busy with her children and besides, Simon doesn’t approve of the few she has left.

 It’s almost by accident that Marianne starts to learn more about Caroline. But once started, she can’t stop, because what she finds makes her wonder: is the question she should be asking not &quot;should I be jealous&quot; but...&quot;should I be scared?&quot;

 When you&#x27;ve been set up

 to lose everything you love,

 what is there left to fight for?

 As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes.

 Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves.

 When Haymitch&#x27;s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He&#x27;s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who&#x27;s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he&#x27;s been set up to fail. But there&#x27;s something in him that wants to fight . . . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena."><img class="cover" src="covers/Suzanne Collins/Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel</td><td>The Hunger Games</td><td data-sort=""></td><td>Suzanne Collins</td><td>Jefferson White</td><td>2025-03-18</td><td>Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>12:48</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Suzanne Collins/The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - A Hunger Games Novel.jpg" data-title="The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - A Hunger Games Novel" data-series="The Hunger Games" data-index="" data-author="Suzanne Collins" data-narrator="Santino Fontana" data-year="2020-05-19" data-genre="Teen &amp; Young Adult:Literature &amp; Fiction:Action &amp; Adventure" data-duration="16:16" data-desc="It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the 10th annual Hunger Games.

 New York Times bestselling author Tarryn Fisher delivers a pulse-pounding, fast-paced suspense novel that will leave you breathless. A thriller you won’t be able to put down!

 Imagine that your husband has two other wives.

 You’ve never met the other wives. None of you know each other, and because of this unconventional arrangement, you can see your husband only one day a week. But you love him so much you don’t care. Or at least that’s what you’ve told yourself.

 But one day, while you’re doing laundry, you find a scrap of paper in his pocket—an appointment reminder for a woman named Hannah, and you just know it’s another of the wives.

 You thought you were fine with your arrangement, but you can’t help yourself: you track her down, and, under false pretenses, you strike up a friendship. Hannah has no idea who you really are. Then Hannah starts showing up to your coffee dates with telltale bruises, and you realize she’s being abused by her husband. Who, of course, is also your husband. But you’ve never known him to be violent, ever.

 Who exactly is your husband, and how far would you be willing to go to find out?

 And who is his mysterious third wife?

 Joan Goodwin has been obsessed with the stars for as long as she can remember. Thoughtful and reserved, Joan is content with her life as a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and as aunt to her precocious niece, Frances. That is, until she comes across an advertisement seeking the first women scientists to join NASA’s space shuttle program. Suddenly, Joan burns to be one of the few people to go to space.

 Selected from a pool of thousands of applicants in the summer of 1980, Joan begins training at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, alongside an exceptional group of fellow candidates: Top Gun pilot Hank Redmond and scientist John Griffin, who are kind and easygoing even when the stakes are highest; mission specialist Lydia Danes, who has worked too hard to play nice; warmhearted Donna Fitzgerald, who is navigating her own secrets; and Vanessa Ford, the magnetic and mysterious aeronautical engineer, who can fix any engine and fly any plane.

 As the new astronauts become unlikely friends and prepare for their first flights, Joan finds a passion and a love she never imagined. In this new light, Joan begins to question everything she thinks she knows about her place in the observable universe.

 Then, in December of 1984, on mission STS-LR9, it all changes in an instant.

 Minalan gave up a promising career as a professional warmage to live the quiet life of a village spellmonger in the remote mountain valley of Boval. It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese.

 For six months things went well: He found a quaint little shop, he befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and, best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes.

 Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins - gurvani, they call themselves - bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy - and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: To hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins.

 When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: There are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies. Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend, and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you&#x27;ll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins.

 All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker&#x27;s son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger."><img class="cover" src="covers/Terry Mancour/Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1</td><td>Spellmonger</td><td data-sort="1.0">1</td><td>Terry Mancour</td><td>John Lee</td><td>2017-02-07</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Action &amp; Adventure</td><td>18:22</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/Thefirstdefier/Defiance of the Fall - A LitRPG Adventure.jpg" data-title="Defiance of the Fall - A LitRPG Adventure" data-series="Defiance of the Fall" data-index="1" data-author="Thefirstdefier, Jf Brink" data-narrator="Pavi Proczko" data-year="2021-06-08" data-genre="Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic" data-duration="23:30" data-desc="Zac was alone in the middle of the forest when the world changed...

 When an injury throws a young, battle-hungry orc off her chosen path, she may find that what we need isn&#x27;t always what we seek.

 Set in the world of New York Times bestselling Legends &amp; Lattes, Travis Baldree&#x27;s Bookshops &amp; Bonedust takes us on a journey of high fantasy, first loves, and second-hand books.

 Viv&#x27;s career with the notorious mercenary company Rackam&#x27;s Ravens isn&#x27;t going as planned.

 Wounded during the hunt for a powerful necromancer, she&#x27;s packed off against her will to recuperate in the sleepy beach town of Murk—so far from the action that she worries she&#x27;ll never be able to return to it.

 What&#x27;s a thwarted soldier of fortune to do?

 Spending her hours at a beleaguered bookshop in the company of its foul-mouthed proprietor is the last thing Viv would have predicted, but it may be both exactly what she needs and the seed of changes she couldn&#x27;t possibly imagine.

 Still, adventure isn&#x27;t all that far away. A suspicious traveler in gray, a gnome with a chip on her shoulder, a summer fling, and an improbable number of skeletons prove Murk to be more eventful than Viv could have ever expected.

 “Take a break from epic battles and saving the world. This is a low-stakes fantasy that delivers exactly what&#x27;s advertised: a wholesome, cozy novel that feels like a warm hug. This is my new comfort read.”—Genevieve Gornichec, author of The Witch&#x27;s Heart, on Legends &amp; Lattes

 The much-beloved BookTok sensation, Travis Baldree&#x27;s Legends &amp; Lattes, is novel of high fantasy and low stakes.

 Come take a load off at Viv&#x27;s cafe, the first &amp; only coffee shop in Thune. Grand opening!

 Worn out after decades of packing steel and raising hell, Viv, the orc barbarian, cashes out of the warrior’s life with one final score. A forgotten legend, a fabled artifact, and an unreasonable amount of hope lead her to the streets of Thune, where she plans to open the first coffee shop the city has ever seen.

 However, her dreams of a fresh start filling mugs instead of swinging swords are hardly a sure bet. Old frenemies and Thune’s shady underbelly may just upset her plans. To finally build something that will last, Viv will need some new partners, and a different kind of resolve.

 A hot cup of fantasy, slice-of-life with a dollop of romantic froth.

 Early Years, book one:

 I never believed in the whole “light at the end of the tunnel” folly where people, after having a near-death experience, would startle awake in a cold sweat exclaiming, “I saw the light!” But there I was, in this so-called “tunnel” facing a glaring light, when the last thing I remembered was sleeping in my room - the royal bed-chamber, as others called it. Had I died? If so, how?

 King Grey once benefited from unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability but now finds himself reborn in a society dominated by magic. Given a second chance at life, the once-king strives to understand his role in this new world and the purpose of his reincarnation while correcting the mistakes of his past.

 New Heights, book two:

 I had a family now, I had people who loved me. It was a feeling I never wanted to give up. I’d treasure it, fight for it if I had to...and for that, I needed to better myself. More so even than when I had been a king.

 Given a second chance at life, Arthur Leywin wishes above all to grow strong enough to protect his family, as the memory of his cold and disconnected past life as King Grey still haunts him. To this end, Arthur adopts the persona of the masked adventurer, Note, and delves into the dungeons under the forbidding Beast Glades. On his adventures, Arthur discovers a strange magical blade that responds to the dragon’s will inside him, befriends a powerful young conjurer whose past is shrouded in mystery, and battles the deadly Elderwood Guardian. Yet all his efforts might prove for naught when Arthur makes an enemy of a talented conjurer from a very powerful family, putting his very future at risk."><img class="cover" src="covers/Turtleme/The Beginning After the End- Publisher&#x27;s Pack.jpg" alt="Cover of The Beginning After the End: Publisher&#x27;s Pack" loading="lazy" /></button></td><td>The Beginning After the End: Publisher&#x27;s Pack</td><td>The Beginning After the End</td><td data-sort="1.0">1-2</td><td>Turtleme</td><td>Travis Baldree</td><td>2019-12-03</td><td>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy:Fantasy:Epic</td><td>12:25</td></tr><tr><td><button class="cover-btn" data-cover="covers/V.a.

 Meanwhile, the world as a whole is in turmoil. The Republic of Mercenaries has been turned upside down thanks to Oracle’s schemes, and to top it off the Primordial Spirit of the region has been missing, but all of this is not something that directly concerns Amber.

 At least, not until she finds herself venturing towards the Primordial Spirit tower in the Republic of Mercenaries in need of something important, where great and difficult trials await her. Where once more, she will have no choice but to risk her life for her goals.

 But Amber will overcome it all, whether it is the troubles in the Sacred Forest, or the status quo of the Republic of Mercenaries; she will come out stronger."><img class="cover" src="covers/V.a.

 What is Ship of Theseus, and who is its mysterious author V.M. Straka? Conceived by filmmaker J.J.

Ship of Theseus is at its core and is the final book written by a man shrouded in deception and violence.

Abducted onto the eponymous ship, the main character is swept into a story that spans oceans and ports, mountains and caves, capitals and citadels.

 Living alone in the kingdom of Atal, former tech student Justin must explore his new home on his own and decide who&#x27;s worthy of learning the kind of magic that comes so easily to him. In a land where magic equals power, the choice of who can be trusted to use mana productively is now his to make, a responsibility he doesn&#x27;t take lightly.

 Secretly, Justin (now known as Elian) is still learning the finer points of the manipulation of mana. As he experiments with the creation of coveted Earth items, even those that have little meaning in this place—iron, for example—he&#x27;s called upon to make something his people truly need: weapons. And when the time comes, he&#x27;ll pour himself into the creation of a weapon that could save lives, including his own, in a battle that will shake the foundations of his new world.

 Polishing the skills he&#x27;s learned and determining what might be beneficial to introduce to some trusted others, Justin grows into a man with his own credo and rapid-fire use of mana. A teacher and a valued asset in the expansion of the kingdom, he&#x27;ll face unthinkable obstacles and heart-breaking betrayals before the fierce, unexpected clash that will call on every one of his skills before the last man has fallen.

Faced with exotic, glowing plants he&#x27;s never seen before and a luminescent pool of crystal-blue water that exerts a frightening pull over him, he&#x27;s literally reborn in a rough, raw landscape—in a time before history began . . .

 Reduced to a helpless child but somehow retaining his adult memories, Elian—as he&#x27;s now known—must come to know the family that has claimed him, all the while learning a strange new language and the culture of this foreign land, where he must survive until he can attempt to return home.

 Alana wasn’t always a child of the Kingdom of Bergond. In fact, she hails from an entirely different world. But an accident on Earth left her dead, and she was reincarnated as the daughter of a farmer and his wife in the hamlet of Orsken. Now, she’s learning how to live in a land vastly unlike that which she came from—and how to wield the new powers she possesses. For, even by the rules of her strange new home, Alana is special: a young bard capable of mending wounds, counteracting poisons, and healing the sick, all through the use of mana and her own mind.

 But as she cultivates her newfound abilities through training with various teachers in the magical arts, those around her are struggling. War has torn the empire apart, and famine is disrupting the simple lives of the villagers. When the conflict comes right to their doorstep, Alana is separated from her family and forced to set out on her own. To remain safe and have any chance of reuniting with those she loves, she will need to apply all her cunning, sorcery, and knowledge—both of this world and Earth. Because there are forces that would do anything to control her, and they’re growing ever closer to discovering who and where she is.

 Alana has not had an easy second life. Ever since she was reborn in the Kingdom of Bergond after meeting her untimely demise on Earth, she’s struggled—first, as the poor daughter of a peasant farmer; next, as an orphan on the run from the war; then, as a formidable novice mage with skills well beyond most of those her age. Now, she’s facing a challenge unlike any she’s had to confront in this world before: school.

 Within the hallowed halls of the Bergond Academy of Mages, Alana must contend with an entirely new set of political and personal struggles—from understanding the mores of dealing with wealthy nobles to hiring a maid to help with her daily duties to navigating (for a second time) adolescent flirtations, romances, friendships, and puberty.

 And as if that weren’t enough, as Alana’s skill in spellcasting, magical-item creation, and combat grows, it becomes clear to her professors that she’s no ordinary student. Alana must figure out how to keep her past life a secret while using her otherworldly knowledge to the best of her ability. Because war is looming ever closer—and not all the students at the academy will make it out unscathed.

 Now that Lord Durin is in charge, everything’s more complicated. For one thing, Alana’s father is Durin’s right-hand man, which means the teen must contend with courtly manners, stuffy traditions, and noble obligations, though she’d rather be practicing how to create portals and fight monsters. For another, Durin’s rule is still tenuous, leaving him and all who support him open to attack.

But none of those trials compare to what she will find when she lands in Atali: an ancient power that could forever transform Bergond—and a startling connection to a life Alana thought she&#x27;d all but left behind . . .

 “To survive in this galaxy, you need a wand in one hand and a gun in the other.”

 On a little-known planet, Archmage Varic Vallenar casts a grand spell to empower himself with the magical abilities of his alternate selves. The ritual works too well, granting Varic not only the magic but also the memories from six lives.

 Including their gruesome deaths.

 Now, Varic has power greater than any wizard in galactic history, but he knows that won’t be enough. The enemies he faced in those alternate lives were apocalyptic in scale. Terrors of technology and magic. Nothing that he, or anyone, can defeat.

 Sun-eating extra-dimensional insects, shadowy secret organizations, genetically enhanced alien super-soldiers, ruthless megacorporations, and hordes of cyborg undead all lurk in the darkest corners of the galaxy, and Varic knows that any of them can become a world-ending threat at any moment.

 All these are beyond any wizard, no matter how many spells he’s mastered or how many interstellar warships he’s rallied to his cause. Hopeless, Varic finds himself trying to preserve what little he can from the coming doom.

 Until he hears rumors of a mythical starship, an invincible vessel of heroes made to do battle against galactic threats.

 A ship called The Last Horizon.

I make the ones who can.”

 The battle with the Iron Legion has left The Last Horizon battered and broken, drifting in space. Varic needs an exceptional engineer to fix his ship, and there’s only one person for the job: Mell, the master Aether technician.

 But first, they have to break her out of prison.

 Mell has been captured by the Advocates, a group of superpowered vigilantes who dominate their corner of the galaxy. They are led by Starhammer, an invincible champion with a personal obsession with Mell.

 The Last Horizon may be crewed by the greatest heroes in the galaxy, but even they have to be careful with Starhammer. Every time he survives a battle, he grows stronger.

 In another life, Varic saw the end of that road. If he lets Starhammer become too powerful, the galaxy is doomed.

 The Last Horizon has already sown new legends across the galaxy, tales of monsters defeated and worlds saved. For better and for worse, their reputation is spreading.

 On Karosha, the Perfected gather fleets crewed by inhumanly flawless soldiers. In the Galactic Union, the secretive organization known as Solstice pulls strings in the shadows. And in the depths of Dark Space, after years of silence, the ravenous D’Niss begin to stir.

 Raion Raithe, Knight of The Last Horizon, sees these threats as a chance to redeem himself. He will stand against the danger, and he will stand strong, no matter what it costs.

It had its ups and downs, much like anyone else’s. Being a talented martial artist had definitely been an up, while high school as a whole was a down. His own father was not a great role model, and his uncle was everything he wanted to be.

 To Ash, it felt like a very normal life. Right up until he was literally pulled into a portal that spat him out into another world. One that was full of martial arts. And martial artists who could use magic. To set the very air on fire with a punch or to turn their skin hard as diamonds. To fly through the air, if they had enough power. A world where the strong ruled and the weak died.

 Three years of living his life as one of the citizens, those without power, and Ash has figured out how to survive with his adoptive family and a lot of persistence. His goals in life have become to give back to those who gave to him. And he’d do whatever he had to to do that.

 Except Ash is about to get his life turned around again. Turned around and altered completely. He’s about to discover a treasure from a time long lost. Forgotten. A treasure that is going to change his destiny and give him another direction to go. If he wants it.

 A cultivator.

 He’d become the Count of Dungeon, made a hostage, married off to the false queen’s daughter against his will, and had his county made ground zero for a religious war.

 The smoldering ruins of Dungeon have been cleared, the patterns reset, and Ryker has a task that is more than likely too much for him.

 Hold Dungeon, and give Lauren, the rightful queen, some breathing room.

 It isn’t as if they didn’t deserve it either.

 They had driven him from his home. Chased him physically from the very guild house itself. All the way to the gates of the city.

 Simply because he wasn’t as strong as they expected him to be.

 As strong as he’d expected himself to be.

 He’d returned to the city the next day and left with his means for revenge. Something he’d hidden away and told no one about when he found it in one of his few Dungeon Dives.

 An inactive Dungeon Core.

 A crystal the size of a fist with a soul inside. One that could create anything from mana it wanted to. From monsters and complex cave systems to gold coins.

 Years spent in planning, and unfortunately farming, as he waited. Now it felt like his moment was finally here.

 The Dungeon Core had been acting strange lately. As if it were finally… coming to life.

 Watching over the crystal like a hawk for this very event, Ryker impatiently waits. Any day now, it&#x27;d start.

 And he could set about taking his vengeance.

 Starting with ripping the soul of the dungeon out.

 Warner has been using his powers considerably since then. Cutting down all who would stand before him and attempt to stop him in his personal crusade.

 The price he had to pay for such a power cost him his life. He was forced to the point of giving all of himself to redeem the original holder of the right of Retribution, Warin.

 Warner was quick to pay that price.

 His effort was paid back to him in triplicate when Warin willingly passed the mantle to him. Giving all of what he was to Warner, effectively ending his life.

 Now Warner is the holder of the rights for Vengeance, Retribution, and Redemption.

 Each power has recognized him and responds willingly, allowing him to blend all three of them with growing mastery.

 Long gone are the days of being sick after utilizing them.

 Now the only concern Warner faces is the correct usage of those powers and when to use them.

 The world is an ever-shifting gray area that gets murkier by the year.

 Warner has been using his powers considerably since then. Cutting down all who would stand before him and attempt to stop him in his personal crusade.

 The price he is forced to pay for such power is catching up to him. Catching up to him and forcing him to pay...with interest.

 Spending more of his time sick and wretched after overuse of the power, he must now begin to wonder about the balance in his own life.

 Each time he finds himself throwing up golden vomit that turns to blood, he has to wonder just how much damage he is causing to his own body.

 Except a great change in the world is coming. One that will force a reckoning no one wishes, with Warner becoming a massive lightning rod for it.

 The very world trembles with the actions he’s taken, and quails in fright at what he must do next.

 He got up, went to work, answered phone calls in a call center, went home, spent time with his daughter, and went to sleep.

 Only to repeat the pattern over and over and over.

 Life was as mundane as anyone could ever fear it to be.

 Today was the day that all that would change.

 On this day, his daughter Maya would be nearly fatally injured, plunging Warner into a world of paranormal creatures, monsters, and magic he’d never known existed.

 The only consolation is that he discovers he’s not quite human, either.

 Nor is he very happy with the way of the world or how it spun. Built on corruption, lies, and injustice for all.

 An unlikely answer comes to him that fits his wounded heart.

 Justice handed out by him personally. Vengeance and retribution in equal measure to all that deserve it.

 Using his newfound powers and unbending determination, Warner is going to carve a path through the world that’ll send the darkest corners of existence fleeing before him. Even as he crushes them beneath his furious strikes.

 The very world will tremble with his actions and fear his coming.

 Edmund, however, is just such an individual.

 He works for Legion: a corporation of unimaginable reach that he barely understands, a corporation that seems determined to put itself smack dab in the middle of a brewing civil war between Super Heroes and Super Villains.

 That doesn’t even take into account the fact that the governments of the world don’t seem to be taking too keenly to Legion, either.

 All of that is mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He works for the company and does all he can to make sure they succeed.

 From cleaning up after a bad operation and disposing of bodies to providing hush money, getting rid of agents from opposing intelligence communities, or just helping an informant escape from a Super Villain, Edmund has done it all in this line of work.

 That doesn’t fill up the entirety of his life, however.

 The rest of it is trying to get a date with the woman he likes and looking out for his little sister while hiding the fact he himself has a superpower.

 A superpower that lets him save and load the world whenever he likes as if it were a video game and subject to his personal whims.

 At least, that’s what he thought in the beginning."><img class="cover" src="covers/William D.

 Edmund, however, is just such an individual. He had worked for Legion and his mentor and savior, Felix Campbell.

 Now, though, Edmund is swapping employers. Moving from the only home he had known and the few people he truly cared for to working for Dorothy after she swaps sides. Which essentially means Edmund will soon be working for a Super Villain, who in turn works for an Evil God. A lot like a global corporation, once again.

 All of that is mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He&#x27;ll work and do all he can to make sure they succeed. Because all of this is to get a better result than the previous one, which, while it was a good ending, wasn&#x27;t the best ending. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect route clear.

 Now, Edmund is reloading his Save-States to get back into it and test out something he could never actually handle when he played video games—the Bad Route.

 Working for the Evil version of Dorothy and Zeus while attempting to crush everyone else, all while trying to figure out how he can help his little sister.

 Because Edmund is rather comfortable with his superpower now, as well as the fact that he&#x27;s now quite aware that he&#x27;s the only one who can do it.

 It grew to heights that could stand toe-to-toe with governments, even at a military level. Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed despite becoming a mega-company CEO.

 Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime. Governments still wanted to take everything from Felix and Legion. In the end, Legion had to back down. Retreat back to a new homeworld, losing important people in the process.

 Kit Carrington and Lillian Lux sacrificed themselves to save him and were marooned on a hostile planet. Even as their home world fell into ruin, Felix fell back. He resolved himself to wait for a chance to get back into the fight after tending to his wounded organization.

 Now, the Overgod Runner has just appeared and offered him a second chance to rebuild Legion and crush everyone in his way. If he could do that, and take over the government of the country he’s about to be dropped into, he’ll get Kit and Lily back.

 There was no way Felix would let go of this chance, nor could he even consider the possibility of failure.

 Felix has brought it into the world once again, hiding it behind the name of the &quot;Association,&quot; a neutral party he&#x27;s building up to walk the line between the Guild of Heroes and League of Villains.

 The foundation for all his plans is now in place. The time has come to branch out into becoming a global power—a power that governments can&#x27;t touch, nor would they willingly want to.

 It&#x27;s time to push Legion right into the forefront of everyone&#x27;s mind without them ever realizing what they are looking at. Legion will operate from the sidelines while controlling everyone.

 There is no way Felix would let go of this chance, nor would he even consider the possibility of failure. Kit and Lily are going to come home, and Felix is going to make it happen—regardless of whatever government or organization might try to get in his way.

 Felix got what he wanted. He pushed, pulled, fought, and dug his way through the world to get Legion—or, more accurately, the Association—to the forefront of the world&#x27;s politics. In doing so, he lost something he couldn&#x27;t afford to. Andrea Elex had been lost in the final moments of everything coming together.

 Now Ryker and Runner have come calling to get those favors repaid he promised them, except he only has one thing on his mind: getting Andrea back as soon as possible.

 Fighting against Zeus with the Overgod and the Architect, finishing his business with the Guild of Heroes and League of Villains, pushing the Association and the Legion to the pinnacle of power. All those things were on his to-do list, but to Felix there was only one real answer.

 Sounds great on paper. Run your company, make money, be your own boss, settle down. Except that with running a business, comes an inordinate amount of responsibilities. Like making sure everything keeps running and your people are paid.

 Worrying about the longevity of his company, Felix begins to expand into other cities. So they’ve packed up the car, put in all the requisite forms, gotten the approvals, and set out to start Legion up in a new city.

 The problem, though, is the local government had no idea who they were selling permits to. Approving forms for. To Felix and Legion.

 Ever since he and the Legion had been forced to flee their headquarters four years previous, nothing had gone quite right. In fact, Felix and the Legion have been locked in a shadow war with enemies unknown. Ones with magic that could carve through their technology easily.

 As the rest of the world fell apart, tearing itself to pieces at every turn with the return of the old gods, the Legion has held the chaos back. The price in blood has been climbing slowly, lately.

 Felix suspects there’s a change on the horizon. One that he hasn’t prepared or developed a plan for. Or so his paranoia has been telling him. That there’s a change coming now that’ll shake up the world. One that will turn it inside out, Legion and Felix along with it.

 Felix has decided it’s time to push ahead and act. To finish things and protect his people at the same time. To take his Legion and make it safe.

 Because that’s all that matters in the end to him. His Legion. And it always came first.

Then she pranced around the ashes of it like it was the end of the world and was conjuring up the end times herself. All while breaking in a rookie by the name of Vanessa into the PID. A gung-ho and eager young detective looking to prove herself. Then commandeering and recruiting a cleaning lady who turned out to be an elven dryad sorceress who viewed killing people as little more than emptying the trash can.

 Without a job, more people relying on him than ever, and no direction, Gus is going to have to put on his big boy pants and figure something out. And soon.

 It’s a good thing that he’s a boogieman. Because, being an apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him was something he could fall back on. He could lean into it and make it work for him.

 He’d done it before when he was in the military. Made a name for himself out there in the bloody desert. He was &quot;The Hunter&quot;. A name that the elven mothers now used to instill fear into misbehaving children. A name that grown men and women wouldn’t discuss in polite company. Except, despite Gus’s best intentions to get back to his stable nonlife, he’s going to get thrown right back into the fray. Whether he likes it or not, he’s about to be handed a new problem that’s going to mess up what little remained of his life.

 Unfortunately, his past was going to catch up to him and meet up with his future.

 The thing is, that the people they’re going up against? They’re just out to see the world burn. To send it screaming back down into the dark ages.

 It’s a good thing that he’s a Boogieman.

 Because being an apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him was something he could fall back on even in this situation. To hunt, investigate, and watch from the shadows.

 Wouldn’t be the first time he’d put his life on the line, either.

 Unfortunately, for everyone involved, the long forgotten and primordial past was rearing its ugly head.

 Gus knows he can certainly punch above his own weight class, but this case might just be the one that ends him.

 In the worst of times, one could call him a monster. The reality, though, was that he was a monster hunter. Or that&#x27;s how he liked to style himself.

 In a world of creatures that went bump in the night, few fought for humanity. Fewer still put humanity first. Fighting with sword, blade, or word, their numbers were insufficient.

 Those who did did so from places and situations that the world didn&#x27;t appreciate or condone. That they&#x27;d actively disavow and ignore.

 Unfortunately, for those who fought such a battle, those who stared into the abyss long enough, it most certainly did indeed stare back. Stare back and set roots deep within.

 Jeremiah is about to experience when even the abyss is revealed to be nothing at all, and discovers his own truth.

 Even if it&#x27;s a lie."><img class="cover" src="covers/William D.

 On the outskirts of Rainbow Town, there is an old, abandoned house. They say that if you send a letter detailing your misfortunes there, you could receive a ticket. If you bring this ticket to the house on the first day of the rainy season, you&#x27;ll be granted entrance into the mysterious Rainfall Market—where you can choose to completely change your life.

 No one is more surprised than Serin when she receives a ticket. Lonely and with no real prospects for a future, Serin ventures to the market, determined to create a better life for herself.

 There, she meets a magical cat companion named Issha and they search through bookstores, perfumeries, and fantastical realms while Serin tries to determine what her perfect life will look like.

 Jake, a seemingly average office worker, finds himself thrust into this new world. Into a tutorial filled with dangers and opportunities.

 His new reality should breed fear and concern. His fellow coworkers falter at every turn. Jake, however, finds himself thriving.

 Perhaps... This is the world Jake was meant to be born in.

 Having evolved to C-grade successfully, Jake is ready to enter the most well-known World Wonder in the entire multiverse to get some sweet levels under his belt. However, Nevermore is far more than just an immense dungeon to power up in.

 It’s a competition where newly evolved C-grades compete on Leaderboards to prove themselves in front of the entire multiverse. Geniuses from every universe and faction appear, all of them vying for the top spot and to prove themselves the very best, like no one ever was.

 Faced with tough competition, Jake gleefully takes on the challenge. With four competent comrades at his side, they face floor after floor as he dives deeper and deeper into the depths of Nevermore, encountering new situations, horrible water levels, powerful monsters, Challenge Dungeons, and perhaps even the occasional labyrinth with an overly invested creator.

 Many years and even more levels have passed since Jake and friends entered Nevermore. With quite a number of floors passed, they turn their attention to the Challenge Dungeons.

 These Challenge Dungeons offer – as the name suggests – unique challenges and circumstances, and completing them will earn each Nevermore competitor points and multipliers to their existing points. As things unfold, it quickly becomes clear it’s through these dungeons that the true top-scorer of the Nevermore Leaderboards will be found.

 Jake has no plans on losing out to anyone, especially not his fellow Chosen, Ell’Hakan.

 Follow Jake as he takes on these five dungeons, facing unique challenges, environments, scenarios, and opponents, with perhaps even a few truly worthwhile duels sprinkled in there.

 Oh, and labyrinths. Can’t forget the labyrinths, lest we make Minaga sad.

 The Nevermore Leaderboards competition has gathered more attention than perhaps in any era prior, with gods getting both directly and indirectly involved to see who will eventually come out on top.

 Jake, who has so far been performing above all expectations, enters his final Challenge Dungeon before it’s time to meet up with his party once more. Together, they’ll make a final push to try and climb as many floors as possible before time is up and, hopefully, in the end, find their names atop the Nevermore Leaderboards.

 However, the competition is tough. Jake and his party aren’t the only ones performing far above expectations. Ell’Hakan, the self-proclaimed rival of Jake, has set himself up to rival or even shatter all records prior, aiming for the top spot himself.

 In the end, who will prove themselves the top C-grade of their generation?

 And, perhaps more importantly to Jake, will there be a forced after-party following the Leaderboards reveal?

 In another region of the Tutorial, turmoil amongst the humans quickly died down after a disastrous battle leaves nearly everyone except the Metal Mage William dead.

 Will Jake be able to hunt down the King of the Forest before the Tutorial ends? Does William wake up in time to create even more chaos and fulfill his goal of killing everyone? Who will survive till the end and return to Earth once more?

 Oh, and will Jake ever get a shirt that doesn’t get ripped apart in every single fight?

All the while trying to avoid the responsibilities of having founded the first city on the planet. Oh, and bird friends.

 Meanwhile, all across Earth, Pylons of Civilization are claimed. Cities are constructed, humanity beginning to regain its foothold. Factions grow and expand as political alliances are formed and professional relations are created, as godly and mortal factions alike move to establish themselves as the dominant force on Earth.

 None of which Jake cares too much about while he finds himself far too busy doing what is truly important in life:

 Hunting, alchemy, and getting that D-grade evolution.

 Follow Jake as he and the rest of his fellow Earthlings compete and cooperate in uncovering the secrets of this ancient land while naturally acquiring any and all of that sweet, sweet loot. But not without trouble.

 The ancient defenses still stand between Jake and his rightful bounty, the cursed land itself rising in opposition against the invaders. Vampires of old who have long been dormant are awakened from their slumber, with each one appearing only stronger than the one before. By that logic, Jake truly hoped for a proper final boss of this event; the only question was....

 Would he find the ultimate challenge from the vampires or his fellow man?

 And what could be a better idea than invading a massive termite hive to craft a new weapon using the extremely powerful curse of resentment from an ancient vampire land? Yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong with that. Ancient curses are well-known for being harmless, after all.

 Assuming all goes well–which it surely will–Jake has one more challenge he must face. Perhaps his most dangerous one yet.

 That’s right, it’s back-to-school season.

 School in this case being an ancient Order worshipping a Primordial snake god.

 An event that hopefully—no, certainly—won’t have any unforeseen Bloodline-induced shenanigans.

 Definitely not.

 The feeble political balance on Earth is shattered as factions take advantage of the sudden turmoil to exercise the wills of their gods. War breaks out, and every force finds themselves implicated one way or another.

 On his way to face the enemy Chosen, Jake explores parts of Earth he has never seen before, makes new allies, gets to know more of the Malefic Viper’s most treasured secrets through incredibly invasive visions of the past, improves his abilities, and gets plenty of those sweet, sweet levels.

 But before all that… it’s time to dispense justice upon the most evil beings in all of existence: Mushroom Men.

 The evolution itself will have no surprises, right?

 Jake will no doubt learn more about himself in his quest to explore his own abilities, and of course some things don’t go entirely as expected…but little does Jake know just how much his happy little accidents can send tremors through the multiverse and the impact it can have.

They discovered their old foes weren&#x27;t gone, as they&#x27;d thought. Not only were they not gone, but they were also stronger than before. Morgan would have to deal with this threat while at the same time trying to restore some sort of quality of life to his community.

 But this wasn&#x27;t going to be easy. With the bombing at the market and the wounding of his daughter, Taylor, it became all too clear to Morgan that he was once again in a fight for the lives of those who mattered most to him. Taylor was injured and would need care for some time. It wouldn&#x27;t be easy. Added to that was the realization that he would have to deal with second-guessing himself. Was it his fault that she was now hurt?

 In Avenging Home, we see how this long-running battle between Morgan&#x27;s people and their number one nemesis plays out. While Morgan thinks this is the biggest threat they face, there are things on the horizon he cannot yet see that are going to dwarf these problems.

 Morgan has lived in a vacuum. He&#x27;s had little information about the outside world. While he&#x27;s used radios to listen to what he can, there&#x27;s been precious little real information. But now he&#x27;s found what he believes to be a reliable source and knows when and where to listen. But is it valid? Or is it simply propaganda? News and information can be powerful tools, but they must always be taken in context to make an educated decision. And the challenge is that there&#x27;s only one source. When you have to make decisions that mean the difference between life and death, the process becomes even more critical.

 So we&#x27;ll follow Morgan and his tightly knit group as they are once again in the fight. Will they finally defeat the federal thugs in their backyard? And, more importantly, what will be the cost?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/A.

The Japanese fleet off the coast of California was wiped out. An even that Morgan and friends and family only knew about because of the radio broadcasts from the Radio Free Redoubt. So far removed from them it barely warranted notice. That is until the Chinese retaliated by launching a nuclear counter-strike against Mac Dill Air Force base. This, did warrant their attention and had the potential to profoundly impact their lives.

 As bad as the fear of nuclear fallout was, it wasn&#x27;t the only threat still haunting northern Lake county. With proof the Russians had pathfinder units on the ground, at a minimum, in the state and discovery of Cuban forces cooperating with them, something had to be done. After encountering armored units and realizing they were ill equipped to deal with the threat, the old man called for help. The call was answered, but would require a near impossible trip by truck to Eglin Air Force base. America was certainly on the ropes, but she wasn&#x27;t down yet.

 All Morgan wants to do is protect his family and friends. To restore a normal sense of life. To see to it Mel and his girls are safe and protected. He doesn&#x27;t want to get involved in these military actions. He&#x27;s more focused on trying to restore power to town. But his desires are, to use a military term, overtaken by circumstances, and, once again, Morgan and his friends are compelled to get involved. And this time, it will cost them."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/A. American/Conflicted Home.jpg" alt="Cover of Conflicted Home" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Conflicted Home</span></div>

But just when Morgan thinks things are assuming some kind of normal, another surprise lands in his lap. He&#x27;s made sheriff.

 Harkening back to a time when law enforcement was a local face in the community, Morgan is forced to step up and be that face, much to his chagrin. With the help of Thad, Danny, and the rest of the crew, he accepts the challenge and tries to make a positive impact. But he&#x27;s in for yet another surprise. New foes will arise, and old ones will return to conspire to destroy his efforts.

There was the promise of power once again. The plant was being repaired, and it looked as though it may actually run. While it meant lots of hard, sweaty work, the reward was worth the investment. The farm was growing strong, and community involvement was good. People were finally coming to terms with the fact that they needed to work together. So far Mother Nature had been on their side. But that, too, was about to change.

 There was no shortage of problems. There were those in town with their own plans. And those plans did not include Sheriff Morgan Carter. For the most part, Morgan ignored the issue, thinking it would simply go away. But that was not to be. He would have to face it head on, and it just may cost him his life. As serious as the issues in town were, there were other much larger problems brewing. These were beyond his control. They were beyond the control of the entire community, even if they were banded together. And Morgan would not be able to simply ignore them either. There were forces converging on Central Florida that would bring back the uncertainty that only recently appeared to be vanquished. Only this time it would be far worse than a rogue band of federal agents. War was coming, and with it death. It would test them all."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/A.

 &quot;Astounding. Thrilling. Amazing.&quot;  (Gillian Flynn)

 &quot;Unputdownable.&quot;  (Stephen King)

 &quot;A dark, twisty confection.&quot;  (Ruth Ware)

 &quot;Absolutely gripping.&quot;  (Louise Penny)

 For listeners of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade&#x27;s most anticipated debuts, to be published in 36 languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: A twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house.

 It isn&#x27;t paranoia if it&#x27;s really happening....

 Anna Fox lives alone - a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times...and spying on her neighbors.

 Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn&#x27;t, her world begins to crumble. And its shocking secrets are laid bare.

 What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one - and nothing - is what it seems.

 Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.

 Bonus: Includes an interview with author A. J. Finn."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/A. J. Finn/The Woman in the Window - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of The Woman in the Window - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Woman in the Window - A Novel</span></div>

 Number one audiobook 2017.

 Welcome my friends!

 Welcome...to “The Land&quot;!

 The battle of the dead was won, but at a great cost. Sion, leader of the Mist Village, was left with only pain and regret as Richter was claimed by the abyss.

 What no one but the abandoned chaos seed knows is that he narrowly avoided the curse of the lich Singh, a curse that still hangs above his head. Now, surrounded by miles of darkness and tons of crushing rock, Richter has to find his way back into the light.

 The only problem is that this monster of a man is being pursued by monsters, a demon, and his own foolish choices. Faced with all the dangers of the deep dark, what will Richter say when the buried horrors of The Land come a calling and asked if he&#x27;s paid his dues?

 Well he&#x27;ll look right back, stare that horror in the eye, and say, &quot;Yes sir, the check is in the mail!&quot;

 Welcome back my friends! Welcome back...to The Land!

 A mesmerizing tale reminiscent of the wonder of Ready Player One and the adventure of Game of Thrones

 Number one in epic fantasy, cyberpunk, and video game fantasy

 In The Land: Predators, the Mist Village has harnessed its power. With core buildings, Professional fighters, and now their own Dungeon, the settlement is primed to grow into a kingdom of true power and magic. The path to power has not been without risk, however. The Mist Village has been noticed.

 Evil nobles from the Kingdom of Law, bloodthirsty goblins from the Serrated Mountains, an undead lord with a penchant for human sacrifice, and fanatical kobolds from the Depths all plot the village&#x27;s destruction. The predators are circling. Richter&#x27;s people are horribly outnumbered by foes whose own power has been entrenched for thousands of years.

 Richter and Sion need to be stronger than ever before. Luckily, they are. New skills have been learned, stronger enchantments have been wrought, and the hundreds of villagers have answered the call to adventure. The Companions do not stand alone. While many eyes have turned toward the mists, wanting to take the treasures within, the Mist Village stares back with a simple message.

 Welcome to the Centennial.

 Every 100 years, the island of Lightlark appears to host the Centennial, a deadly game that only the rulers of six realms are invited to play. The invitation is a summons—a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm’s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.

 Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling—a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.

 To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray...even as love complicates everything.

 Filled with secrets, deception, romance, and twists worthy of the darkest thrillers, Lightlark is a must-hear for fans of legendary fantasy writers Marie Lu, Marissa Meyer, and Leigh Bardugo."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Alex Aster/Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Lightlark - Lightlark, Book 1</span></div>

 Instant #1 New York Times bestseller.

 The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.

 Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.

 Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.

 Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....

 More praise for The Silent Patient:

 “Absolutely brilliant… I read it in a state of intense, breathless excitement.”—Stephen Fry

 “Smart, sophisticated storytelling freighted with real suspense—a very fine novel by any standard.”—Lee Child

 “The Silent Patient sneaks up on you like a slash of intimidating shadow on a badly lit street. Michaelides has crafted a totally original, spellbinding psychological mystery so quirky, so unique that it should have its own genre.”—David Baldacci"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Alex Michaelides/The Silent Patient.jpg" alt="Cover of The Silent Patient" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Silent Patient</span></div>

Freeing them - revealing the governments unspeakable abuses in the process - is the mission Ruby has claimed since her own escape from Thurmond, the worst camp in the country.

 But not everyone is supportive of the plan Ruby and Cole craft to free the camps. As tensions rise, competing ideals threaten the mission to uncover the cause of IANN, the disease that killed most of America&#x27;s children and left Ruby and others with powers the government will kill to keep contained.

Closely tied to her musical skill, however, is a mysterious power she doesn&#x27;t even know she has. When her two talents collide during a stressful performance, Etta is drawn back hundreds of years through time.

 Etta wakes, confused and terrified, in 1776, in the midst a fierce sea battle. Nicholas Carter, the handsome young prize master of a privateering ship, has been hired to retrieve Etta and deliver her unharmed to the Ironwoods, a powerful family in the Colonies - the very same one that orchestrated her jump back, and one Nicholas himself has ties to. But discovering she can time travel is nothing compared to the shock of discovering the true reason the Ironwoods have ensnared her in their web.

 Another traveler has stolen an object of untold value from them, and, if Etta can find it, they will return her to her own time. Out of options, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the mysterious traveler. But as they draw closer to each other and the end of their search, the true nature of the object, and the dangerous game the Ironwoods are playing, comes to light - threatening to separate her not only from Nicholas, but her path home...forever."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Alexandra Bracken/Passenger - Passenger, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Passenger - Passenger, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Passenger - Passenger, Book 1</span></div>

 When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government &quot;rehabilitation camp.&quot; She might have survived the mysterious disease that killed most of America&#x27;s children, but she and the others emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.

 Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.

 But when the truth about Ruby&#x27;s abilities—the truth she&#x27;s hidden from everyone, even the camp authorities—comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. On the run, she joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp: Zu, a young girl haunted by her past; Chubs, a standoffish brainiac; and Liam, their fearless leader, who is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can&#x27;t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.

 While they journey to find the one safe haven left for kids like them—East River—they must evade their determined pursuers, including an organization that will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. But as they get closer to grasping the things they&#x27;ve dreamed of, Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Alexandra Bracken/The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Darkest Minds - Darkest Minds, Book 1</span></div>

Experience an enthralling performance featuring a cast of rising Broadway stars who join actress and author Alexandra Silber in celebrating the Audible release of After Anatevka, the sweeping historical novel she wrote about Tevye’s second-eldest daughter, Hodel. Silber’s fascination with Hodel began when she played her in a production of Fiddler in London’s West End. Actors often write a backstory for the characters they play so they can fully imagine and embody them onstage. But Silber was more interested in Hodel’s fate than her history. “I had never played a character who felt so much like me,” she says. “I felt responsible for what happened to her after she boards the train to Siberia to join her revolutionary fiancé Perchik.”

 Originally commissioned by Symphony Space, a form of this concert was produced in March 2017. After Anatevka Live brings to life dramatic excerpts from Silber’s novel with five original songs by contemporary composer and lyricist teams, plus two much-loved songs from Fiddler and one gem that was cut from the final song book. Directed by Carolyn Cantor with musical direction by Ben Moss and an introduction from Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning Fiddler lyricist Sheldon Harnick, this is a charming and magical event for any lover of musical theater.

 Maya Killgore is twenty-three and still in the process of figuring out her life.

 Conor Harkness is thirty-eight, and Maya cannot stop thinking about him.

 It’s such a cliché, it almost makes her heart implode: older man and younger woman; successful biotech guy and struggling grad student; brother’s best friend and the girl he never even knew existed. As Conor loves to remind her, the power dynamic is too imbalanced. Any relationship between them would be problematic in too many ways to count, and Maya should just get over him. After all, he has made it clear that he wants her gone from his life.

 But not everything is as it seems—and clichés sometimes become plot twists.

 When Maya’s brother decides to get married in Taormina, she and Conor end up stuck together in a romantic Sicilian villa for over a week. There, on the beautiful Ionian coast, between ancient ruins, delicious foods, and natural caves, Maya realizes that Conor might be hiding something from her. And as the destination wedding begins to erupt out of control, she decides that a summer fling might be just what she needs—even if it’s a problematic one."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ali Hazelwood/Problematic Summer Romance.jpg" alt="Cover of Problematic Summer Romance" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Problematic Summer Romance</span></div>

This intense thriller is made even better by her performance.&quot; (AudioFile Magazine)

 From renowned journalist Alice Feeney comes a riveting new audiobook, Sometimes I Lie.

 My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:

  I&#x27;m in a coma. My husband doesn&#x27;t love me anymore. Sometimes I lie.   Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can&#x27;t move. She can&#x27;t speak. She can&#x27;t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn&#x27;t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it.

 Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from 20 years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it&#x27;s the truth?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Alice Feeney/Sometimes I Lie.jpg" alt="Cover of Sometimes I Lie" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Sometimes I Lie</span></div>

 A cocky diplomat with a black belt in sarcasm

 A sociopath scientist with a fondness for shooting her bunkmates

 Lan spends her nights as a songgirl in Haak’gong, a city transformed by the Elantian colonizers. Her days are consumed by the search for knowledge about the strange mark—an untranslatable Hin character—burned into her arm by her mother in her last act before she died.

 Zen is a practitioner—one of the fabled magicians of the Last Kingdom. He’s never seen anything like Lan’s mark, but he knows that if there are answers, they lie deep in the pine forests and misty mountains of the Last Kingdom, with an order of practitioning masters planning to overthrow the Elantian regime.

 Yet, both Lan and Zen are hiding secrets—secrets that are buried deep within them. Secrets that even they have still to unearth. Both hold the power to liberate their land, if they don&#x27;t destroy it first.

 Now the battle for the Last Kingdom begins.

 Jazz Bashara is a criminal. Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you&#x27;re not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you&#x27;ve got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent.

 Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she&#x27;s stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.

 Bringing to life Weir&#x27;s brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel&#x27;s The Defenders, Sin City, Death Proof). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they&#x27;re one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz&#x27;s first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It&#x27;s a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Andy Weir/Artemis.jpg" alt="Cover of Artemis" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Artemis</span></div>

 A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the number-one New York Times best-selling author of The Martian.

 Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the Earth itself will perish.

 Except that right now, he doesn&#x27;t know that. He can&#x27;t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.

 All he knows is that he&#x27;s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he&#x27;s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

 His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that&#x27;s been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it&#x27;s up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

 And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.

 Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian - while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.

 But in the woods, there&#x27;s a playhouse with a chilling history.

 Two years ago, the McGregors&#x27; daughter Elodie was abducted and then died in that playhouse. The townspeople insist her abductor had to be a stranger in their town. Alban refuses to knock the playhouse down, even keeping a picture of it on his wall.

 Based on the thrilling real-life story of socialite spy Nancy Wake, comes the newest feat of historical fiction from the New York Times best-selling author of I Was Anastasia, featuring the astonishing woman who killed a Nazi with her bare hands and went on to become one of the most decorated women in WWII.

 Told in interweaving timelines organized around the four code names Nancy used during the war, Code Name Hélène is a spellbinding and moving story of enduring love, remarkable sacrifice, and unfaltering resolve that chronicles the true exploits of a woman who deserves to be a household name.

 It is 1936, and Nancy Wake is an intrepid Australian expat living in Paris who has bluffed her way into a reporting job for Hearst newspaper when she meets the wealthy French industrialist Henri Fiocca. No sooner does Henri sweep Nancy off her feet and convince her to become Mrs. Fiocca than the Germans invade France and she takes yet another name: a code name.

 As Lucienne Carlier, Nancy smuggles people and documents across the border. Her success and her remarkable ability to evade capture earns her the nickname &quot;The White Mouse&quot; from the Gestapo. With a five million-franc bounty on her head, Nancy is forced to escape France and leave Henri behind. When she enters training with the Special Operations Executives in Britain, her new comrades are instructed to call her Hélène. And finally, with mission in hand, Nancy is airdropped back into France as the deadly Madam Andrée, where she claims her place as one of the most powerful leaders in the French Resistance, armed with her ferocious wit, her signature red lipstick, and the ability to summon weapons straight from the Allied Forces.

 But no one can protect Nancy if the enemy finds out these four women are one and the same, and the closer to liberation France gets, the more exposed she - and the people she loves - become."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ariel Lawhon/Code Name Hélène - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Code Name Hélène - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Code Name Hélène - A Novel</span></div>

People have resorted to scavenging from the dead, or taking from the living. The entire industrialized world has become a wasteland of abandoned cars, decaying bodies, and feral animals.

 To stay alive, U.S. Deputy Marshal Mason Raines must forage for food, water, and gasoline while outgunning those who seek to take advantage of the apocalyptic anarchy.

With each deadly encounter, Mason is force to accept his place as one of the nation&#x27;s few remaining lawmen. In a world now populated by escaped convicts, paranoid mutants, and government hit squads, his only hope to save the townspeople is to enforce his own brand of frontier justice.

 Halfway across the country, a killer is released from prison. With hopes set on a fresh start, he rescues a young girl desperate to get home. As they travel across the wasteland that once was the United States, they must call upon every bit of strength and courage to survive not only the horrors of the new world but also a violent government agenda."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Arthur T.

 A New York Public Library Best Book of 2023

 &quot;A gorgeous love story from one of the finest romance writers out there.&quot;—Carley Fortune, New York Times bestselling author of Every Summer After

 Sometimes, the worst day of your life happens, and you have to figure out how to live after it.

 So Clementine forms a plan to keep her heart safe: work hard, find someone decent to love, and try to remember to chase the moon. The last one is silly and obviously metaphorical, but her aunt always told her that you needed at least one big dream to keep going. And for the last year, that plan has gone off without a hitch. Mostly. The love part is hard because she doesn’t want to get too close to anyone—she isn’t sure her heart can take it.

 And then she finds a strange man standing in the kitchen of her late aunt’s apartment. A man with kind eyes and a Southern drawl and a taste for lemon pies. The kind of man that, before it all, she would’ve fallen head-over-heels for. And she might again.

 Except, he exists in the past. Seven years ago, to be exact. And she, quite literally, lives seven years in his future.

 Her aunt always said the apartment was a pinch in time, a place where moments blended together like watercolors. And Clementine knows that if she lets her heart fall, she’ll be doomed.

 After all, love is never a matter of time—but a matter of timing."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ashley Poston/The Seven Year Slip.jpg" alt="Cover of The Seven Year Slip" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Seven Year Slip</span></div>

 In A Psalm for the Wild-Built, Hugo Award-winner Becky Chambers&#x27;s delightful new Monk and Robot series gives us hope for the future.

 It&#x27;s been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness, never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend.

 One day, the life of a tea monk is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of &quot;what do people need?&quot; is answered.

 But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how.

 They&#x27;re going to need to ask it a lot.

 Becky Chambers&#x27;s new series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?

 After discovering the shocking secret buried deep within The Green, Violet has a grave decision to make.

 Trust the woman who saved her, or not?

 So far, everything about the woman has taken Violet by surprise. Her behavior has been honest and upfront - a refreshing change for Violet. Besides, with one of her loved ones hanging on life support and the other close to falling completely out of reach, Violet doesn&#x27;t exactly have a lot of choice.

 Her only way forward is to embark on a dicey excursion. For this, she knows, she needs the Liberators&#x27; help - and must be prepared to take whatever risks that come with.

 But what neither she nor any of her new Liberator comrades can prepare for is just how deep the lies of their homelands run....

 For all those child dino fanatics who didn’t grow up to become paleontologists, dinosaurs seem like something out of mythology. They are dragons, pictures in books, abstract, other, extinct.

 They are at the same time familiar and mysterious. And yet we’re in an age of rapid discovery - new dinosaur species and genera are being discovered at an accelerating rate, we’re learning more about what they looked like, how they lived, how they evolved and where they all went.

 A “mind-blowing” (Entertainment Weekly) speculative thriller about an ordinary man who awakens in a world inexplicably different from the reality he thought he knew—from the author of Upgrade, Recursion, and the Wayward Pines trilogy

 “Are you happy with your life?”

 Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the kidnapper knocks him unconscious.

 Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits.

 Before a man he’s never met smiles down at him and says, “Welcome back, my friend.”

 In this world he’s woken up to, Jason’s life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college professor but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.

 Is it this life or the other that’s the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how will Jason make it back to the family he loves?

 From the bestselling author Blake Crouch, Dark Matter is a mind-bending thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we’ll go to claim the lives we dream of."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Blake Crouch/Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Dark Matter (Movie Tie-In) - A Novel</span></div>

Bobby Hall’s stellar narration is accompanied by music he performed specifically for this story.

 “Bobby Hall has crafted a mind-bending first novel, with prose that is just as fierce and moving as his lyrics. Supermarket is like Naked Lunch meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest - if they met at Fight Club.” (Ernest Cline, number one New York Times best-selling author of Ready Player One)

 Flynn is stuck - depressed, recently dumped, and living at his mom’s house. The supermarket was supposed to change all that. An ordinary job and a steady check. Work isn’t work when it’s saving you from yourself. But things aren’t quite as they seem in these aisles. Arriving to work one day to a crime scene, Flynn’s world collapses as the secrets of his tortured mind are revealed. And Flynn doesn’t want to go looking for answers at the supermarket. Because something there seems to be looking for him.

 A darkly funny psychological thriller, Supermarket is a gripping exploration into madness and creativity. Who knew you could find sex, drugs, and murder all in aisle nine?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Bobby Hall/Supermarket.jpg" alt="Cover of Supermarket" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Supermarket</span></div>

 Led by philosopher and metaphysician Professor Van Helsing - Dracula&#x27;s most indomitable adversary - Harker, Mina, and a band of allies unite, determined to confront and destroy the Count before he can escape.

 Bram Stoker ingeniously modernized gothic folklore by moving his vampire from traditional castle ruins to modern England. With Dracula, which has been interpreted and dissected by scholars for generations, Stoker changed the vampire novel forever.

 Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus, and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell - the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home.

 Now, the Superiority - the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life - has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator.

 Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy.

 The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return.

 To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Cytonic - Skyward, Book 3</span></div>

 When a ghost ship is discovered, its crew presumed dead after trying to reach the storm-shrouded island Akina, Navani Kholin must send an expedition to make sure the island hasn&#x27;t fallen into enemy hands. Knights Radiant who fly too near find their Stormlight suddenly drained, so the voyage must be by sea.

 Shipowner Rysn Ftori lost the use of her legs but gained the companionship of Chiri-Chiri, a Stormlight-ingesting winged larkin, a species once thought extinct. Now Rysn&#x27;s pet is ill, and any hope for Chiri-Chiri’s recovery can be found only at the ancestral home of the larkin: Akinah. With the help of Lopen, the formerly one-armed Windrunner, Rysn must accept Navani&#x27;s quest and sail into the perilous storm from which no one has returned alive. If the crew cannot uncover the secrets of the hidden island city before the wrath of its ancient guardians falls upon them, the fate of Roshar and the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive.jpg" alt="Cover of Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Dawnshard - Stormlight Archive</span></div>

 Spensa made it out of the Nowhere, but what she saw in the space between the stars has changed her forever. She came face to face with the Delvers, and finally got answers to the questions she’s had about her own strange Cytonic gifts.

 The Superiority didn’t stop fighting for galactic dominance while she was gone, though. Spensa’s team, Skyward Flight, was able to hold Winzik off, and even collect allies to help with the cause, but it’s only a matter of time until humanity—and the rest of the galaxy—falls.

 Defeating them will require all the knowledge Spensa gathered while in the Nowhere. But being Cytonic is more complicated than she ever could have imagined. Now, Spensa must ask herself: how far is she willing to go for victory, if it means losing herself—and her friends—in the process?

 The final book in the Skyward series will free humanity, or see it fall forever.

 This new edition begins with a preface by author Dan Wells, the first person to read the completed novel, and a new afterword by Sanderson explaining how he came to write the book and its place in the Cosmere, the unified universe of all his Tor novels.

 Also included is an expanded version of the &quot;Ars Arcanum&quot; appendix, with more of the technical details of the book&#x27;s magic that fans can never get enough of.

 Elantris was truly a milestone both for Sanderson and for the genre of epic fantasy.

They intercept a strange transmission from the planet Evershore and its Kitsen inhabitants, who say they have some of Jorgen’s people and want to return them - but can the Kitsen be trusted?

Newcago is free. They told David it was impossible, that even the Reckoners had never killed a High Epic. Yet Steelheart - invincible, immortal, unconquerable - is dead. And he died by David&#x27;s hand.

 Eliminating Steelheart was supposed to make life simpler. Instead, it only made David realize he has questions. Big ones. And no one in Newcago can give him answers.

 Babylon Restored, the city formerly known as the borough of Manhattan, has possibilities, though. Ruled by the mysterious High Epic Regalia, Babylon Restored is flooded and miserable, but David is sure it&#x27;s the path that will lead him to what he needs to find. Entering a city oppressed by a High Epic despot is risky, but David&#x27;s willing to take the gamble. Because killing Steelheart left a hole in David&#x27;s heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic - Firefight. And now he will go on a quest darker and even more dangerous than the fight against Steelheart to find her, and to get his answers."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Firefight - The Reckoners, Book 2.jpg" alt="Cover of Firefight - The Reckoners, Book 2" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Firefight - The Reckoners, Book 2</span></div>

Narrated by Kaleo Griffith and Jennifer Jill Araya.

 All his life, Sixth of the Dusk has been a traditional trapper of Aviar—the supernatural birds his people bond with—on the deadly island of Patji. Then one fateful night he propels his people into a race to modernize before they can be conquered by the Ones Above, invaders from the stars who want to exploit the Aviar.

 But it’s a race they’re losing, and Dusk fears his people will lose themselves in the effort. When a chance comes to sail into the expanse of the emberdark beyond a mystical portal, Dusk sets off to find his people’s salvation with only a canoe, his birds, and all the grit and canniness of a Patji trapper.

 Elsewhere in the emberdark is a young dragon chained in human form: Starling of the starship Dynamic. She and her ragtag crew of exiles are deep in debt and on the brink of losing their freedom. So when she finds an ancient map to a hidden portal between the emberdark and the physical realm, she seizes the chance at a lucrative discovery.

 These unlikely allies might just be the solution to each other’s crisis. In their search for independence, Dusk and Starling face perilous bargains, poisonous politics, and the destructive echo of a dead god.

 Sanderson expands his thrilling novella “Sixth of the Dusk” into a mythic novel of legends, lore, and warring galactic superpowers."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5.jpg" alt="Cover of Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Isles of the Emberdark - A Cosmere Novel Secret Projects, Book 5</span></div>

 Stephen Leeds is perfectly sane. It&#x27;s his hallucinations who are mad.

 A genius of unrivaled aptitude, Stephen can learn any new skill, vocation, or art in a matter of hours. However, to contain all of this, his mind creates hallucinatory people - Stephen calls them aspects - to hold and manifest the information. Wherever he goes, he is joined by a team of imaginary experts to give advice, interpretation, and explanation. He uses them to solve problems...for a price.

 His brain is getting a little crowded and the aspects have a tendency of taking on lives of their own. When a company hires him to recover stolen property - a camera that can allegedly take pictures of the past - Stephen finds himself in an adventure crossing oceans and fighting terrorists. What he discovers may upend the foundation of three major world religions - and, perhaps, give him a vital clue into the true nature of his aspects.

 Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds includes the novellas Legion and Legion: Skin Deep, published together for the first time, as well as a brand-new Stephen Leeds novella, Lies of the Beholder."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Legion- The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds.jpg" alt="Cover of Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds</span></div>

 When the great red star Calamity appeared in the sky, some believed the end had come. They were right.

 Calamity created the Epics: humans with incredible powers they didn&#x27;t deserve.

 They could have saved mankind. They could have lifted us into harmony and prosperity. Instead they burned. They slaughtered. They conquered. And then they ruled.

 Jax has learned all of this the hard way. Orphaned at an early age, he&#x27;s spent most of his childhood training to be a Reckoner - determined to find the Epics&#x27; weaknesses, unlock their secrets, and protect those of us who are still left.

 But now, the mysterious High Epic Lifeforce has arrived with his flying city, Lux, to plunder what&#x27;s left of Texas. So Jax and his ragtag team - the few who remain of the once-mighty Texas Reckoners - must take their battle to this floating fortress of riches - and defeat the invincible.

 In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times best-selling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.

 Dalinar Kholin&#x27;s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost. The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.

 Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar&#x27;s blood-soaked past and stand together - and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past - even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Oathbringer.jpg" alt="Cover of Oathbringer" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Oathbringer</span></div>

 “Don’t trust their lies. Don’t trust their false peace.” That is the warning that Alanik of the planet ReDawn gave the human pilot Spensa after Alanik’s ship crash-landed on Detritus. While accepting an invitation to meet with her people’s enemy, the Galactic Superiority, Alanik heard Spensa’s cry for help across the vastness of space, and she used her cytonic powers to hyperjump her ship to the source of that cry. What she found there was a shock - a whole planet of free humans fighting against the Superiority. Were they the allies her people desperately needed?

 When she recovered from her injuries and met the friendly humans Jorgen and FM of Skyward Flight, she found that her warning to Spensa had gone unheeded by the government of Detritus, and they were considering a peace overture from the Superiority. Now having returned to ReDawn, Alanik is dismayed to learn that her own people are falling into the exact same trap.

 The faction in ReDawn’s government that wants to appease the Superiority has gained the upper hand. With Alanik’s mentor, Renakin captured, she has no one to turn to but Jorgen, FM, and their friend Rig. An ancient technology may have the power to save both of their planets from disaster, but can they discover its secrets before it’s too late?

 An instant number-one New York Times best seller and a USA Today and Indie best seller!

 The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s number-one New York Times best-selling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game.

 After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar’s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.

 Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin’s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.

 At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.

 All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she&#x27;s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumors of his cowardice are true - he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them.

 Spensa is sure there&#x27;s more to the story. And she&#x27;s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars - and it was terrifying. Everything Spensa has been taught about her world is a lie.

 But Spensa also discovered a few other things about herself - and she&#x27;ll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to.

Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.

 But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his will.

 Nobody fights the Epics...nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.

 And David wants in. He wants Steelheart - the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David&#x27;s father. For years, like the Reckoners, David&#x27;s been studying, and planning - and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.

 He&#x27;s seen Steelheart bleed.

 And he wants revenge."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Steelheart - The Reckoners, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Steelheart - The Reckoners, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Steelheart - The Reckoners, Book 1</span></div>

 When a planet-destroying Delver suddenly appears in the sky of Detritus and vanishes just as suddenly, FM knows that the last free human society got lucky. Her Skyward Flight companion, Spensa, figured out how to draw this Delver away, but it won’t be so easy next time.

 The forces of the Galactic Superiority will be back - and if the Defiant Defense Force can’t figure out a way to escape the planet, humanity’s destruction is only a matter of time. Spensa’s mission to infiltrate the Superiority unveiled the secret to their hyperdrives - a cytonic slug species called the Taynix. Now FM’s flightleader, Jorgen, has found a large group of Taynix hiding in the caverns far below Detritus’s surface.

 FM and Jorgen must work together with the engineer Rig to awaken the mysterious alien Alanik and unlock the powers of the Taynix, or humanity will be trapped. With Spensa’s friend Minister Cuna of the Superiority stranded at the outpost of Sunreach, they need to figure out how to rescue them - or the Superiority government will be in the sole clutches of those who want to wipe out Detritus once and for all.

 For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the &quot;Sliver of Infinity,&quot; reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler&#x27;s most hellish prison.

 Kelsier &quot;snapped&quot; and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld&#x27;s elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel&#x27;s plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.

 Like him, she&#x27;s a half-Skaa orphan, but she&#x27;s lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

 This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?

 Who is the Hero of Ages?

 To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness—the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists—is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.

 Having escaped death at the climax of The Well of Ascension only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can&#x27;t even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans!

 The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.

 Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

 It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.

 One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

 Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.

 Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar&#x27;s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan&#x27;s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

 The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.

 Speak again the ancient oaths:

 Life before death.

 Strength before weakness.

 Journey before destination.

 And return to men the Shards they once bore.

 The Knights Radiant must stand again.

 The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler - the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years - has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.

 As Kelsier&#x27;s protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.

 Stopping assassins may keep Vin&#x27;s Mistborn skills sharp, but it&#x27;s the least of her problems.

 Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn&#x27;t run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier&#x27;s crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won&#x27;t get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler&#x27;s hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.

 As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.

 Long-listed, Audible.com Best of the Year, 2024

 The long-awaited explosive climax to the first arc of the #1 New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive—the iconic epic fantasy masterpiece that has sold more than 10 million copies, from acclaimed bestselling author Brandon Sanderson.

 Dalinar Kholin challenged the evil god Odium to a contest of champions with the future of Roshar on the line. The Knights Radiant have only ten days to prepare—and the sudden ascension of the crafty and ruthless Taravangian to take Odium’s place has thrown everything into disarray.

 Desperate fighting continues simultaneously worldwide—Adolin in Azir, Sigzil and Venli at the Shattered Plains, and Jasnah in Thaylenah. The former assassin, Szeth, must cleanse his homeland of Shinovar from the dark influence of the Unmade. He is accompanied by Kaladin, who faces a new battle helping Szeth fight his own demons . . . and who must do the same for the insane Herald of the Almighty, Ishar.

 At the same time, Shallan, Renarin, and Rlain work to unravel the mystery behind the Unmade Ba-Ado-Mishram and her involvement in the enslavement of the singer race and in the ancient Knights Radiant killing their spren. And Dalinar and Navani seek an edge against Odium’s champion that can be found only in the Spiritual Realm, where memory and possibility combine in chaos. The fate of the entire Cosmere hangs in the balance.

 Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status &quot;darkeyes&quot;. Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.

 The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin’s master has much deeper motives.

 Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.

 Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brandon Sanderson/Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2.jpg" alt="Cover of Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Words of Radiance - The Stormlight Archive, Book 2</span></div>

 In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and to be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”

 In Atlas of the Heart, Brown takes us on a journey through 87 of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances - a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection.

 Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power, it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice.

 Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”

 Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.

 Don’t miss the hour-long Netflix special Brené Brown: The Call to Courage!

 Named one of the best books of the year by Bloomberg.

 Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas and has the courage to develop that potential.

 When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it&#x27;s necessary to do good work.

 But daring leadership in a culture that’s defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.

 Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question:

 How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?

 In this new audiobook, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.”

 Whether you’ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this audiobook is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Brené Brown/Dare to Lead - Brave Work.

 The emperor of Annur is dead, slain by enemies unknown. His daughter and two sons, scattered across the world, do what they must to stay alive and unmask the assassins. But each of them also has a life-path on which their father set them, destinies entangled with both ancient enemies and inscrutable gods.

 Kaden, the heir to the Unhewn Throne, has spent eight years sequestered in a remote mountain monastery, learning the enigmatic discipline of monks devoted to the Blank God. Their rituals hold the key to an ancient power he must master before it&#x27;s too late.

 An ocean away, Valyn endures the brutal training of the Kettral, elite soldiers who fly into battle on gigantic black hawks. But before he can set out to save Kaden, Valyn must survive one horrific final test.

 At the heart of the empire, Minister Adare, elevated to her station by one of the emperor&#x27;s final acts, is determined to prove herself to her people.

One of his high school classmates, Danny Corwin, was a vicious serial killer who had raped and mutilated six women, murdering three of them. Yet the town had denied all early signs of the radical evil that was growing within Corwin. What had led the local media to ignore his early rapes? Why had the local Presbyterian Church tried to shield him from prison? Why had local law enforcement been unable to solve and prosecute his murders as they continued?

 Burrough is widely admired as a master storyteller, and this chilling tale raises important questions of whether serial killers can be recognized before they kill or rehabilitated after they do. It is also a story of Texas politics and power that led the good citizens of the town of Temple to enable a demon who was their worst nightmare.

 Stevenson&#x27;s story is one of working to protect basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society - the poor, the wrongly convicted, and those whose lives have been marked by discrimination and marginalization.

 Welcome to Cape Carnage! Visit Once, Stay Forever.

 You can hide in the farthest reaches of the deepest hell, and I will still drag you out. Even the devil can’t save you from me.

 Cape Carnage is a seaside town of colorful houses, quirky shops, and an unusually high body count. With tourists comes trouble, and Harper Starling won’t let anyone ruin her picture-perfect home. A skilled gardener with killer instincts, Harper protects her sanctuary—and her aging mentor with a fading memory—at any cost. Troublesome tourists don’t check out of Carnage. They compost beneath Harper’s award-winning flowerbeds.

 But Nolan Rhodes isn’t your average tourist. Devilishly handsome, disarmingly charming, and skilled with a blade, Nolan is relentless in the pursuit of revenge. On every anniversary of the hit-and-run accident that fractured his life, Nolan slays another target. And he’s saved the best for last: the undeniably beautiful Harper Starling. The problem? Harper isn’t the monster he expected. And she won’t go down without a fight.

 When an amateur true crime investigator comes to Cape Carnage on the trail of a long-lost serial killer, Harper and Nolan strike an uneasy truce. If Nolan helps Harper protect her town, she’ll keep quiet about his hunting habits . . . for now. But their alliance soon spirals into obsession, one that threatens to shatter every secret in Carnage—including their fragile love.

 Tourist Season is a darkly funny, slow burn, enemies-to-lovers romance where destruction and desire are balanced on the edge of a blade—and where love is the most dangerous battleground of all.

Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate.

 In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn&#x27;t much a girl wouldn&#x27;t do for a glass of water.

 Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen&#x27;s reservoirs for as long as she can remember.

 But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone.

 When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares… but it turns out they&#x27;re real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.

 The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist&#x27;s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him… or her.

 Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate.

 His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he&#x27;s the only way Saeris is going to make it home.

 Be careful of the deals you make, dear child. The devil is in the details...

 This Psych 312 assignment just might send me off the deep end. Determining whether love at first sight really exists with Robbie Moravian as my project partner, of all people?

 He’s the sappiest man alive, so upbeat I could scream, and clearly rooting for happy endings at every turn. How does he not learn from experience considering our own meet-cute last semester almost got us expelled?

 But we both need to pass this course to graduate. So we’re interviewing five random couples about their meet-cutes and relationships and spending all this time together. Which is certainly...educational.

 Because it turns out Robbie isn’t just the charming golden boy I thought I knew. There’s some actual depth beneath all those lame dad jokes and the ‘70s-inspired thrift wardrobe (even if he does look ridiculously great in a flared collar). Next thing I know he’s walking me back to my office on the regular and finishing all my sentences and protecting me from freak storms, and...

 Wait. Could Robbie be right? Can happy endings really come from unhappy beginnings? Is he about to change my entire world view?

 Group projects are the worst.

 But Tisaanah will stop at nothing to save those she abandoned. Even if it means gambling in the Orders&#x27;s deadly games. Even if it means sacrificing her heart.

 But winning won’t be easy amongst the most vicious warriors from all three vampire houses. To survive, Oraya is forced to make an alliance with a mysterious rival.

 Everything about Raihn is dangerous. He is a ruthless vampire, an efficient killer, an enemy to her father’s crown…and her greatest competition. Yet, what terrifies Oraya most of all is that she finds herself oddly drawn to him.

 But there’s no room for compassion in the Kejari. War for the House of Night brews, shattering everything that Oraya thought she knew about her home.

 In a kingdom where nothing is more deadly than love, Raihn may understand her more than anyone, but their blossoming attraction could be her downfall.

A young man’s dark obsession with an enigmatic, gorgeous writer leads to murderous consequences in this erotic psychological thriller.

 You walk into the bookstore and you keep your hand on the door to make sure it doesn’t slam. You smile, embarrassed to be a nice girl, and your nails are bare and your V-neck sweater is beige and it’s impossible to know if you’re wearing a bra but I don’t think that you are. You’re so clean that you’re dirty and you murmur your first word to me - hello.

 When aspiring writer and recent Brown graduate Guinevere Beck strides into the bookstore where Joe works, he’s instantly smitten. Beck is everything Joe has ever wanted: she&#x27;s gorgeous, tough, razor-smart, and sexy beyond his wildest dreams. Joe needs to have her, and he&#x27;ll stop at nothing to do so. As he begins to insinuate himself into her life - her friendships, her email, her phone - she can’t resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom-made for her. So when her boyfriend, Benji, mysteriously disappears, Beck and Joe fall into a tumultuous affair. But there&#x27;s more to Beck than her oh-so-perfect façade, and their mutual obsession quickly spirals into a whirlwind of deadly consequences.

 In the wake of the hyperspace disaster and the heroism of the Jedi, the Republic continues to grow, bringing more worlds together under a single unified banner. Under the leadership of Chancellor Lina Soh, the spirit of unity extends throughout the galaxy, with the Jedi and the newly established Starlight Beacon station at the vanguard.

 In celebration, the chancellor plans the Republic Fair, a showcase of the possibilities and the peace of the expanding Republic - a peace the Jedi hope to foster. Stellan Gios, Bell Zettifar, Elzar Mann, and others join the event as ambassadors of harmony. But as the eyes of the galaxy turn toward the fair, so too does the fury of the Nihil. Their leader, Marchion Ro, is intent on destroying this unity. His storm descends on the pageantry and celebration, sowing chaos and exacting revenge.

 As the Jedi struggle to curb the carnage of the rampaging Nihil, they come face-to-face with the true fear their enemy plans to unleash across the galaxy - the kind of fear from which even the Force cannot shield them."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Cavan Scott/Star Wars- The Rising Storm (The High Republic).jpg" alt="Cover of Star Wars: The Rising Storm (The High Republic)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Star Wars: The Rising Storm (The High Republic)</span></div>

 Terrence Mack was born poor, grew up tough, and died hard. Waking up in a sea cave with nothing but the clothes on his back and a new bullet scar was enough to convince him that wherever his death had brought him, it wasn&#x27;t paradise.

 His new world quickly proves to be a place of danger, magic, monsters, and - for Terry at least - women.

 Known on Celestine as a template, Terry&#x27;s genes are key to the survival of the eldritch races. But the fiercely competitive eldritch don&#x27;t typically leave their lovers alive long, and aren&#x27;t accustomed to taking &#x27;no&#x27; for an answer.

 The average life expectancy of a template on Celestine? Three days.

 A city boy with no survival skills to speak of, Terry sets out in a desperate bid to gather allies. With the help of a lonely dryad, a mixed-up minotress, and a misguided party of dungeon delvers, he must be brave, cunning, and good with the ladies to have any hope of living through the month.

 All the while an ancient evil bent on the destruction of Celestine exists in the north, and templates are the key to its southern expansion....

 Long before the First Order, before the Empire, before even The Phantom Menace ...Jedi lit the way for the galaxy in The High Republic

 It is a golden age. Intrepid hyperspace scouts expand the reach of the Republic to the furthest stars, worlds flourish under the benevolent leadership of the Senate, and peace reigns, enforced by the wisdom and strength of the renowned order of Force users known as the Jedi. With the Jedi at the height of their power, the free citizens of the galaxy are confident in their ability to weather any storm But the even brightest light can cast a shadow, and some storms defy any preparation.

 When a shocking catastrophe in hyperspace tears a ship to pieces, the flurry of shrapnel emerging from the disaster threatens an entire system. No sooner does the call for help go out than the Jedi race to the scene. The scope of the emergence, however, is enough to push even Jedi to their limit. As the sky breaks open and destruction rains down upon the peaceful alliance they helped to build, the Jedi must trust in the Force to see them through a day in which a single mistake could cost billions of lives.

 Even as the Jedi battle valiantly against calamity, something truly deadly grows beyond the boundary of the Republic. The hyperspace disaster is far more sinister than the Jedi could ever suspect. A threat hides in the darkness, far from the light of the age, and harbors a secret that could strike fear into even a Jedi’s heart."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Charles Soule/Star Wars- Light of the Jedi - The High Republic.jpg" alt="Cover of Star Wars: Light of the Jedi - The High Republic" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Star Wars: Light of the Jedi - The High Republic</span></div>

 Nicole Cutty and Megan McDonald are both high school seniors in the small town of Emerson Bay, North Carolina. When they disappear from a beach party one warm summer night, police launch a massive search. No clues are found, and hope is almost lost until Megan miraculously surfaces after escaping from a bunker deep in the woods. A year later the best-selling account of her ordeal has turned Megan from local hero to national celebrity. It&#x27;s a triumphant, inspiring story except for one inconvenient detail: Nicole is still missing.

 Nicole&#x27;s older sister, Livia, a fellow in forensic pathology, expects that one day soon Nicole&#x27;s body will be found, and it will be up to someone like Livia to analyze the evidence and finally determine her sister&#x27;s fate. Instead the first clue to Nicole&#x27;s disappearance comes from another body that shows up in Livia&#x27;s morgue - that of a young man connected to Nicole&#x27;s past. Livia reaches out to Megan for help, hoping to learn more about the night the two were taken. Other girls have gone missing, too, and Livia is increasingly certain the cases are connected. But Megan knows more than she revealed in her blockbuster book. Flashes of memory are coming together, pointing to something darker and more monstrous than her chilling memoir describes. And the deeper she and Livia dig, the more they realize that sometimes true terror lies in finding exactly what you&#x27;ve been looking for."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Charlie Donlea/The Girl Who Was Taken.jpg" alt="Cover of The Girl Who Was Taken" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Girl Who Was Taken</span></div>

 Ranger-General. Banshee Queen. Warchief. Sylvanas Windrunner has borne many titles. To some, she is a hero—to others, a villain. But whether in pursuit of justice, vengeance, or something more, Sylvanas has always sought to control her own destiny.

 The power to achieve her goals has never been closer, as Sylvanas works alongside the Jailer to liberate all Azeroth from the prison of fate. Her final task? Secure the fealty of their prisoner—King Anduin Wrynn.

 To succeed, Sylvanas will be forced to reflect on the harrowing path that brought her to the Jailer’s side and to reveal her truest self to her greatest rival. Here, Sylvanas’s complete story is laid bare: the breaking of the Windrunner family and her rise to Ranger- General; her own death at the hands of Arthas and her renewed purpose in founding the Forsaken; the moment she first beheld the Maw and understood the true consequences of what lay beyond the veil of death.

 But as her moment of victory draws near, Sylvanas Windrunner will make a choice that may ultimately come to define her. A choice that’s hers to make."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Christie Golden/Sylvanas (World of Warcraft).jpg" alt="Cover of Sylvanas (World of Warcraft)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Sylvanas (World of Warcraft)</span></div>

 When the world was young, all life shook before the might of Galakrond, a massive primal dragon whose hunger could not be sated. Five primal dragons rose valiantly beside the titan-forged Keeper Tyr to combat this threat. Though the fight was desperate, Galakrond fell by their teeth and talons, and the five were chosen to become protectors of Azeroth. The titans gifted Nozdormu, Ysera, Alexstrasza, Malygos, and Neltharion with Order magic, transforming them into the Aspects: powerful dragons with command of time, nature, life, magic, even the earth itself. Other primal dragons followed on their path, and, imbued with the titans’ power, the dragonflights rose to shape the world and serve the Aspects.

 That is the tale the dragonflights have always told . . . but it is not the whole story.

 For as Alexstrasza and her flights set to reshaping Azeroth, not all of dragonkind sees Order magic as a gift. Spurning the titans’ interference, a group of rebel primal dragons are imbued with the elemental powers of the planet and are reborn as the Incarnates. Led by Iridikron, the Incarnates believe that dragonkind should be subservient to no one. They foment a rebellion against the Aspects: what they are and all they represent.

 Despite the efforts of Alexstrasza and her primal friend Vyranoth to preserve peace, both sides slip closer to violence, as dragons are forced to choose a side or be swept up in the growing conflict. With battle lines and allegiances drawn, the war among dragonkind shakes the foundation of the world. Both sides realize they will have to make sacrifices to secure the future of their kind, sacrifices that will cascade through the ages."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Courtney Alameda/War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft- Dragonflight).jpg" alt="Cover of War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft: Dragonflight)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>War of the Scaleborn (World of Warcraft: Dragonflight)</span></div>

 We were fighting on the wrong side of a war we couldn&#x27;t win. And that was the good news.

 The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits.

 When the morning sky twinkled again, this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn&#x27;t even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren&#x27;t our enemy. Our allies are.

 I&#x27;d better start at the beginning."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Craig Alanson/Columbus Day - Expeditionary Force, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Columbus Day - Expeditionary Force, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Columbus Day - Expeditionary Force, Book 1</span></div>

 Academy Award nominee Diane Lane narrates this tale about a Hollywood power broker who travels to Alabama to convince a reluctant author that the studio’s treatment of his best-selling book would make the perfect blockbuster romantic comedy.

 What Heather Thiesen knows about marriage is that hers is sputtering, anything but romantic, and utterly exhausting. It’s her job to iron out the details of movie deals with people like Brock Lewis, the self-published and conservative author of Atomic Marriage, even if his preachy rules for a happy, thriving marriage make her want to go back to bed. Harried and married, with a young child at home, she can barely get through the book’s 12-point Atomic Doctrine, let alone follow its advice. Make eye contact with your spouse? Always! Use the bathroom in front of them? Never!

 But then she meets Brock. And to her surprise, she likes him—a lot.

 Curtis Sittenfeld is one of America’s funniest and most astute cultural commentators. Diane Lane is one of our best leading actresses, sharing Heather’s perspective with depth, candor, and warmth. Together they deliver a remarkable story about the life partners we choose, the secrets we keep, and the compromises we make—or break."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Curtis Sittenfeld/Atomic Marriage.jpg" alt="Cover of Atomic Marriage" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Atomic Marriage</span></div>

J. Palmer, the author of Saving Meghan.

 What makes Simon Fitch so perfect?

  He knows all her favorite foods, music, and movies. Her son adores him. He was there when she needed him most. He anticipates her every need. He would never betray her like her first husband.  The perfect husband. He checks all the boxes.

 The question is, why?

 Nina Garrity learned the hard way that her missing husband, Glen, had been leading a double life with another woman. But with Glen gone - presumably drowned while fishing on his boat - she couldn&#x27;t confront him about the affair or find closure to the life he blew apart.

 Now, a year and a half later, Nina has found love again and hopes she can put her shattered world back together. Simon, a widower still grieving the death of his first wife, thinks he has found his dream girl in Nina, and his charm and affections help break through to a heart hardened by betrayal. Nina&#x27;s teenage son, Connor, embraces Simon as the father he wishes his dad could have been, while her friends see a different side to him, and they aren&#x27;t afraid to use the word obsession.

 Nina works hard to bridge the divide that’s come between her daughter and Simon. She wants so badly to believe her life is finally getting back on track, but she’ll soon discover that the greatest danger to herself and her children are the lies people tell themselves.

 Cal has all of the answers to these age-old questions for a very simple reason. He is a Dungeon Core, a soul forced against his will into a magical stone. With the help of an energetic friend, Cal grows a dungeon around himself to bring in new sources of power.

 When a threat he doesn&#x27;t fully comprehend bares its many teeth, Cal is determined to survive the attempt on his life.

 Cal learns quickly that the primary threat is not the far-off war, but the actions of those entrusted with protecting the population. As it turns out, the idea of using a flying dungeon as a war machine is very tempting indeed.

 Dale has been facing his trials better than anyone could have hoped for, but when the war takes a turn for the worse, his role is forcibly relinquished. Since his only chance at survival is painful and rapid advancement, Dale must learn if his strength of will can develop into strength of flesh.

Food, parties, food, entertainment, and food are the minimum requirement. As an orphan, specifically a reviled Leap, there’s not even a chance of being treated as a human.

 When a celestial event pours time magic into his field, coalescing into a lost Weapon of Power, Grant leaps at the opportunity to advance beyond even the scope of standard cultivation. At the first touch of the weapon, the orphan gains everything he’s ever wanted: a Sword and a Name. Also, a pesky mandatory quest with his life as the price of failure. It doesn’t take him long to realize that the best thing for him to do is to sell it and live on borrowed Time.

 Yet, that would never happen. The blade offers him the first major choice he’s ever had to make: surrender to his desires...or live like a king."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Dakota Krout/Lord January.jpg" alt="Cover of Lord January - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 1)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Lord January - A LitRPG Cultivation Saga (Year of the Sword, Book 1)</span></div>

 Nacho and the Chips Guild are expanding rapidly, both in membership as well as reclaiming land for their burgeoning city. The presence of a cook allows people to gather in large numbers without fear of starving to death, though the reluctant Guild Leader knows better than to let people get too comfortable. Careful management of people has never been his forte, but luckily he has surrounded himself with people who can get that job done as he focuses on learning to craft proper meals.

 As Nacho begins to find a sense of peace in his life, he is suddenly thrust into a new battle when the CruxTerrans launch a surprise attack. They seize several of Nacho&#x27;s closest friends and use them to unlock a hidden portal that will determine the fate of Earth as well as CruxTerra. The Guild Leader and his adversaries are thrust into a daunting challenge that neither side is prepared for, testing their abilities...and especially their willpower.

 As the threat to Earth begins to reach its peak, all of humanity has a choice: flee to Eternium, or stay for an uncertain future. Some stay, some go, some don&#x27;t make the choice quickly enough.

 Lily Red, known as &quot;Little Red&quot;, has trained her entire life to become a system-acknowledged scout under her Grandmother&#x27;s guidance. Hunting, tracking, and trap-making—she&#x27;s a master of her craft. But her dreams of joining the elite Scout forces are repeatedly blocked by a leader of the Wyld with a grudge against Grandmother.

 When Lily uncovers an impending invasion by Wolf Warband, brutal raiders from the frozen north, a deadly challenge offered by their war leader sets her pulse racing. She&#x27;s his partner in prophecy, so as far as he&#x27;s concerned she&#x27;s the only person in the way. Little Red races away to warn the Wyld, but the city&#x27;s rulers mock her warnings as fairy tales, dismissing the threat entirely. Undeterred, she vows to protect the people of Canu Moch herself.

 But Lily isn&#x27;t about to back down. She&#x27;ll be the competent protector of the people of Canu Moch—whether they want her or not. With the three city-states planning to ignore the danger, she strikes out on her own, quickly finding herself on the razor&#x27;s edge between duty and ambition as Little Red pits herself against the Big Bad Wolf.

 Rebecca Punzel grew up as an orphan in the slums, only daring to dream small by providing for her found family. In a kingdom where might makes right, and combat skills rule, her first class is practically a curse: golden locks of hair which require no care. Though she&#x27;s in a hairy situation, she works tirelessly to build a modest life for the other orphans.

 At fourteen, every valuable in reach seems to get tangled into her curls. Practically overnight, she&#x27;s blacklisted from working at any reputable business. Losing her internal battle of morality just so she can survive, Rebecca turns to the thieves guild and quickly makes a name for herself as Goldie Locks. But when a job goes wrong and a ruthless alchemist marks her as an endless source of magical material, she has only one option: run.

 When even that fails, she stakes everything on climbing the Brute Queen&#x27;s battle tower. The grand prize of the trial of power is protection and status—marriage to the Crown Prince. Her attempt is practically a joke: without combat skills they&#x27;d never accept the royal and the orphan as a pair. Luckily, winning isn&#x27;t the goal, escaping is. After all . . .

 Zero is just one of 20,000 people aboard a spaceship bound for a new planet set to be colonized. The journey is over a century long but luckily, everyone is in stasis, so they’ll be safe and sound asleep during the trip. Everyone that is, except for Zero, whose pod has malfunctioned, waking him up a hundred years early.

But how did we acquire the most advanced form of communication on Earth? Daniel L. Everett, a &quot;bombshell&quot; linguist and &quot;instant folk hero&quot; (Tom Wolfe, Harper&#x27;s), provides in this sweeping history a comprehensive examination of the evolutionary story of language, from the earliest speaking attempts by hominids to the more than 7,000 languages that exist today.

 Although fossil hunters and linguists have brought us closer to unearthing the true origins of language, Daniel Everett&#x27;s discoveries have upended the contemporary linguistic world, reverberating far beyond academic circles. While conducting field research in the Amazonian rainforest, Everett came across an age-old language nestled amongst a tribe of hunter-gatherers. Challenging long-standing principles in the field, Everett now builds on the theory that language was not intrinsic to our species. In order to truly understand its origins, a more interdisciplinary approach is needed - one that accounts as much for our propensity for culture as it does our biological makeup."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel L.

First, he was an Aspirant, then a Knight, and finally, he had become a Lord. In the end, he stopped fighting it, realizing that he would need the social status to keep his promise to Myna and avenge the deaths at Oakwood.

 Leaving Hearthglen behind, the family moved to the center of Queendom, the city of Accord. As the most important city in the Queendom, Accord had been Shaped from the ground up around the central tree that towered above every other structure in the city. The gigantic tree housed all of the city functions, and was the first project the Queens had undertaken on this world.

 Sean and his family began to build the allies they could, knowing that Accord would see them dealing with more politics. Hallie set out to make allies with the lesser nobles—with the help of Dame Daria Iceblood—leaving Sean free to focus on his new healing clinic. After all, healing could give him the chance to win more people over.

 Little did they know that the one they sought to undermine, Lord Truestrike, was already making strides toward his own plans. Soon, Accord would bear witness to two nobles vying to pull each other down…though hopefully without invoking the ire of the Advisor."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Accord - Binding Words, Book 9.jpg" alt="Cover of Accord - Binding Words, Book 9" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Accord - Binding Words, Book 9</span></div>

He knew that removing those who still stood against him would be difficult, but with his friends and family by his side, he started making plans.

 Sean knew better than to simply rush off and commit murder. He worked to protect those dear to him, using his Talents and knowledge to bend the rules of the world he found himself in—sometimes near the breaking point—to craft new marvels.

 New doors opened when he healed the sister of Knight Toivo Bloodheart, setting more events into motion. Dame Hallie Bloodheart, for her part, proposed a plan to shield Sean from Lord Sharpeyes’s retaliation. She would marry him, which would raise Sean to the station of Knight.

 Sean accepted the proposal with his wives’ approval, but first, he married Helga, his Chooser. The former Valkyrie was torn over how she should feel about Sean and treat him, but she loved him and was happy to fully join their family.

 With two new wives and his intentions set, Sean went to Lord Sharpeyes’ party. Though his plan to force the Lord into a duel was thwarted, so too was Lord Sharpeye’s plan to murder all of his enemies. The battle left many nobles dead and Lady Sharpeyes indebted to Sean.

 Once all of his troubles in Hearthglen had been dealt with, Sean was ready to move on. While the massive city of Accord was certain to present its own problems, Sean felt confident that he could face them with the backing of his family and friends."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8.jpg" alt="Cover of Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Accorded Nobility - Binding Words, Book 8</span></div>

 His personality was forged by his childhood, and he was determined to find a way to make his past work for him.

 As soon as he could, Zander decided to find work as a military contractor. The company he’d badgered for a job eventually hired him, earning him the nickname “Badger.” While most people dropped out of the lifestyle after a few years, Zander had found a place that felt right to him.

 A decade in, he’d even found a couple of friends who stayed on with him. One was Devin Smith, the heavy weapons specialist for the squad and a proud Texan. Another was Selda Engel, their tech specialist. She’d slowly transitioned from a friend to a friend-with-benefits, but even that had started to become more.

 On rotation again, Zander made a vow to ask Selda to recognize their relationship as more than just a casual hookup, planning to do so as soon as they were back off schedule. The universe, however, was about to remind him of a crucial lesson and old adage: “Life is what happens when you’re busy making plans.” Sent out into the desert on what looked like a wild goose chase, they were about to head back when everything changed.

 Shifted by quantum entanglement from Earth to an alien planet, Zander and his squad would have to adapt—and quickly—if they wanted to live. As they tried to understand what was happening, the stark truth of their new reality thrust itself on the shaken humans. Giant machines of war were attacking an equally humongous bug.

 And, quite unfortunately, the giant bug had a lot of little friends. The ensuing firefight ended with Zander left as the sole human survivor. Out of his dimension and wounded, he had to face an entirely new universe, and the Antecedents&#x27; Legacy would soon become the primary focus of his life."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Antecedents&#x27; Legacy - Antecedents&#x27; Legacy, Book 1</span></div>

Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot, who had to walk a thin line to not favor Sean too much, lest she earn the Queens’ ire.

 With his friends and allies, Sean time and again thwarted Lord Truestrike and his minions. He even befriended his daughter, Dame Trisha Truestrike, giving her hope that she might one day see Darragh again. It was when Sean brought down the Greater Vampire, Luka, that High Lady Queensblood pushed for the duel Sean had long sought.

 During the duel, Truestrike’s treachery was revealed when he summoned a Life Bonded dragon to kill Sean. Sean almost died a few times, but even a dragon bowed before him at the end. Ironically, it wasn’t Sean who finally killed Lord Truestrike. No, it was Trisha, who slew her father to avenge her lover, Darragh.

 With Lord Truestrike’s death, Trisha was destined to take over the Truestrike House and have her son returned to her from her father’s grasp. That ended in tragedy, as the spoiled brat struck her down for ‘stealing his birthright.’ His reign only lasted as long as it took the guard to remove his head from his shoulders.

 But more bad news was waiting— the scribes had sent messages to the Queens. Both Winter and Summer were coming, and Sean wouldn’t be able to avoid them. That put him on the clock to pull off what the stories had said he would do: find the Huntsman.

 To manage that, he’d need to figure out how to open a portal back to Earth. If he did, Sean would likely find an old enemy waiting for him; Thor hadn’t forgotten the slights against his name, and he wanted revenge.

 Time was ticking away, and Sean had to work fast. His wives, especially Fiona, were counting on him. Sean had never backed down from a challenge, and he wasn’t about to start now. He’d either figure out how to create a portal, or he’d end up facing the Queens on less than diplomatic terms."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11.jpg" alt="Cover of Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Divine Agreements - Binding Words, Book 11</span></div>

 If that wasn&#x27;t enough for someone to deal with, things got worse for him. His one-time friends got tired of him, making him a target of their boredom and anger. This left the growing child with no safe haven—at school or home, someone was hurting him every day.

 Then, something miraculous happened: the Heavens stepped in, granting him a Sphere. Spontaneous manifestation of a Sphere was very rare, but it happened on occasion. Benedict, while being beaten unconscious and having his bones broken, was suddenly the Holder of a Sphere of Regeneration.

 A passerby broke up the attack on Benedict and got him whisked off to a clinic to see a Healer. The Healer not only found his newest injuries completely repaired, but also the long list of injuries Benedict had endured throughout his life. That examination turned up the fact that Benedict now had a Sphere and, as such, was bound for the Academy to learn how to deal with his new life.

 He was shown around by Agatha, his psychiatrist. She&#x27;d help him learn the things that his school had never told him about Holders. It was also on his first day that he&#x27;d met Atropos Rosaria Foxglove, his roommate, who had her own problems.

 He&#x27;d have to learn to coexist with a roommate who disliked him, all while trying to find his new place as a Holder of a Sphere. One of the few non-elite students, he would have an uphill climb. Benedict never backed down from a fight or pain, and he wasn&#x27;t about to start now."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Heavenly Chaos - Heavenly Chaos, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Heavenly Chaos - Heavenly Chaos, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Heavenly Chaos - Heavenly Chaos, Book 1</span></div>

All he wanted to do was craft and love his wives, and it seemed like the peaceful life he hoped for might be within his reach.

 Denmur and Lord Sharpeyes would not let that happen. Using their connections, they put into motion a chain of events that would reverberate across the city of Hearthglen. Sean was called to attend the Lord’s party - he came, bringing all of his family and friends with him.

 Both sides were surprised by events as they unfolded, and it quickly became apparent that conflict would not be denied. With the Einherjar, a Valkyrie, and an old foe, Velin Dykstra, backing them up, Evan Sharpeyes and Klein Denmur challenged Sean to trial by combat.

 Exhausted and with depleted energy, Sean still led his wives onto the field of battle. The fight was bloody and taxing, but in the end, Sean struck down Evan Sharpeyes before collapsing. With his eyesight fading, Sean looked at his wives, but only saw a few female-like figures rushing toward him. The last sound he heard was a great many wings converging on him, and his mind drifted to thoughts of Morrigan....

 Word of Sean’s victory spread throughout the city, but none could say whether he had survived to enjoy it.

At the end of that battle, he claimed Helga Helsdottir, soul-bonding her and renaming her Helga Oathsworn. With a Valkyrie by his side, Sean hoped never to lose another loved one to death. His enemies were far from done with him, however.

 Attacks on the association and their families started, claiming lives and hurting Sean’s friends. Finished with just trying to live his life, Sean made plans to take on his enemies directly. The turning point came when Sean confronted Denmur and his group outside the Golden Lion. Helga struck down Denmur’s champion, Knight Mithrilarm, during the ensuing duel, causing Denmur to snap. The fight left Denmur, plus dozens of others, dead. Even that wasn’t the end - the corrupt guards in Lord Sharpeyes’ pay arrested Sean and Helga.

 As they were brought before Magister Amuret, Sean discovered just how far he’d pushed his enemies when he was attacked and killed in the courtroom. Death could not stop Sean while he had energy to invoke his gifts from the Tuatha. Pushing death away, Sean got back to his feet and killed the guards and magistrate who had tried to murder him. He was brought before the unusually reasonable chief magistrate, who found Sean innocent of any wrongdoing.

 Sean’s bond with Helga gave him access to new planes, including the Bog. That was where the souls of Sean’s foes now went if they died while in combat with him. In an effort to find out more about who was directing the attacks against him, Sean paid a visit to the dead in the Bog. He was determined to end the troubles facing him, even if it meant finding a noble solution."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Noble Solutions - Binding Words, Book 7.jpg" alt="Cover of Noble Solutions - Binding Words, Book 7" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Noble Solutions - Binding Words, Book 7</span></div>

The plan was to take away Lord Truestrike’s powerbase, then move against him, with Hallie working to strengthen their ties with the nobility. Sean knew better than to get involved with that side of things, knowing he’d just say the wrong things to the wrong people.

 While Hallie worked on alliances, Sean focused on healing, bringing the conflict with Truestrike to the fore— the Lord tried to use his influence to push Sean out of the healing guild. The attempt failed spectacularly, as not only was Sean not thrown out, he ended with the majority of the guild siding with him.

 Having the healers behind him helped Sean do more. Truestrike’s plots to injure the city guard kept being thwarted, and with the healers on his side, Sean was able to save the majors being targeted. His actions in stopping every attempt to destabilize the guards earned him goodwill with Commander Queensblood.

 Beyond helping the guard, Sean also enforced a broken Agreement, bringing him before Advisor Mackenzie Earthfoot. He was meant to explain why he’d cost a noble his hand, but Sean did what he always did: he proved his innocence by helping someone. Giving Mackenzie her foot back put her into debt to him, giving him powerful allies just as the gala began.

 The gala was a night of politics. Sean healed those his friends brought him to and tried to not react when he finally met Truestrike. The conflict that happened wasn’t with Lord Truestrike, but his daughter, Trisha. After asking Sean for a dance, the Dame accused Sean of killing Darragh back in Oakwood, then shoved him and stormed off the dance floor.

 With the gala over, Sean wondered what was going to happen next. He’d made more allies, been recognized before all of society by the Advisor, and his clash with Truestrike was known. The only thing he was sure of was that the Queens would learn about him, and now, his time was running out before they came to Accord."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Daniel Schinhofen/Truestrike&#x27;s Treachery.jpg" alt="Cover of Truestrike&#x27;s Treachery" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Truestrike&#x27;s Treachery</span></div>

 Beneath the light of three moons, the world of Aster Fall lies shattered. Classes are broken, Outsiders are invading, and the future is unknown. The ancient guardians have left and no one knows where they have gone. The fate of the world lies with one young man. Sam Hastern.

 His family has been cursed by a broken class for the last fifty years. No one has ever managed to level it, condemning them to the lowest paying jobs and life in a barren village. It is called Battlefield Reclaimer. The only information he has is the class description that it is an ancient enchanter and smith, along with a quest to seek out a battlefield and learn how to reclaim the artifacts of the past.

 There&#x27;s one more little problem. Sam&#x27;s about to have it even worse when a dungeon exploration leaves him looking distinctly non-human.

 All he wants is to protect his family and study magic, but to do that, he&#x27;ll learn ancient magic and walk in the footsteps of the old rulers of the galaxy.

 But Fin’s secret identity doesn’t stay hidden for long. After all, it’s not every day a house witch and his kitten familiar, Kraken, take to meddling in imperial affairs. As his powers are gradually discovered by the court, Fin finds himself involved in a slew of intrigues: going head-to-head with knights with less-than-chivalrous intentions, helping to protect the pregnant queen, fending off the ire of the royal mage, and uncovering a spy in the castle. And that’s only the beginning—because Fin’s past is catching up with him just as his love life is getting complicated . . .

 Filled with fascinating characters, courtly intrigue, political machinations, delicious cuisines, cuddly companions, magical hijinks, and will-they-won’t-they romance, The House Witch is the first in a captivating new series, guaranteed to satisfy the tastes of any listener.

 The first volume of the hit romantic-fantasy series—with more than a million views on Royal Road!"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Delemhach/The House Witch- A Humorous Romantic Fantasy.jpg" alt="Cover of The House Witch: A Humorous Romantic Fantasy - The House Witch, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The House Witch: A Humorous Romantic Fantasy - The House Witch, Book 1</span></div>

 “I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this book! I didn&#x27;t want this story to end!”—Reese Witherspoon

 “Painfully beautiful.”—The New York Times Book Review

 For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens.

 Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Delia Owens/Where the Crawdads Sing.jpg" alt="Cover of Where the Crawdads Sing" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Where the Crawdads Sing</span></div>

 Being a sentient spaceship really should be more fun. But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can&#x27;t stay out of trouble.

 They&#x27;ve created enough colonies so humanity shouldn&#x27;t go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.

 Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.

 Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.

 All These Worlds is the third installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Dennis E.

 Bob Johansson didn&#x27;t believe in an afterlife, so waking up after being killed in a car accident was a shock. To add to the surprise, he is now a sentient computer and the controlling intelligence for a Von Neumann probe.

 Bob and his copies have been spreading out from Earth for 40 years now, looking for habitable planets. But that&#x27;s the only part of the plan that&#x27;s still in one piece. A system-wide war has killed off 99.9 percent of the human race; nuclear winter is slowly making the Earth uninhabitable; a radical group wants to finish the job on the remnants of humanity; the Brazilian space probes are still out there, still trying to blow up the competition; and the Bobs have discovered a spacefaring species that sees all other life as food.

 Bob left Earth anticipating a life of exploration and blissful solitude. Instead he&#x27;s become a sky god to a primitive native species, the only hope for getting humanity to a new home, and possibly the only thing that can prevent every living thing in the local sphere from ending up as dinner.

 Listener favorite Ray Porter returns to narrate Bob - and his many incarnations - in all of their geeky glory.

Taylor.

 More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate - whatever the cost.

 But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob’s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse’s problems.

 Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender’s trail. But what they discover out in deep space is so unexpected and so complex that it could either save the universe - or pose an existential threat the likes of which the Bobiverse has ever faced.

 Davi has done this all before. She’s tried to be the hero and take down the all-powerful Dark Lord. A hundred times she’s rallied humanity and made the final charge. But the time loop always gets her in the end. Sometimes she’s killed quickly. Sometimes it takes a while. But she’s been defeated every time.

 This time? She’s done being the hero and done being stuck in this endless time loop. If the Dark Lord always wins, then maybe that’s who she needs to be. It’s Davi’s turn to play on the winning side.

But when she&#x27;s captured trying to rob a vault that belongs to a secret guild of villains, she&#x27;s offered a hard choice: prove she has what it takes to join them or be eliminated.

 Apprenticed to one of the world&#x27;s most powerful (and supposedly dead) villains, she is thrust into a strange world where the lines that divide superheroes and criminals are more complex than they seem. The education of a villain is not an easy one, and Tori will have to learn quickly if she wants to survive. On top of the peril she faces from her own teacher, there are also the capes and fellow apprentices to worry about, to say nothing of having to keep up a civilian cover.

 Most dangerous of all, though, are those who loathe the guild&#x27;s very existence. Old grudges mean some are willing to go to any length to see the guild turned to ash, along with each one of its members.

Lander is home to the Hero Certification Program, a curriculum designed to develop students with superhuman capabilities, commonly known as Supers, into official Heroes. Five of this year&#x27;s freshmen are extra special. They have a secret aside from their abilities - one that they must guard from even their classmates.

 For every one person in the world with abilities they can control, there are three who lack such skill.

 What exactly happened beyond the Outer Rim? Revan can’t quite remember, yet can’t entirely forget. Somehow he stumbled across a terrible secret that threatens the very existence of the Republic.

 As a newly minted healer, Zoe doesn&#x27;t need a unique ability to take on murderous cultists, an equally murderous paladin, and the weather. She&#x27;d certainly like one, though. It&#x27;s a fast-paced, violent world, filled with undead ghouls, sprawling dungeons, and far too many scheming nobles, all of whom want a piece of her. A healer is a valuable asset—and becoming a demon and blood magic user only ups the ante.

 But when life doesn&#x27;t give you a cheat power, you figure out how to take it. And Zoe&#x27;s new demon side reveals the first step to do just that:

Created to extend human lifespans, it quickly makes world-changing discoveries in health science. It also develops an advanced VR headset that uses consumable nanomachines to let users experience time faster in virtual worlds.

 Two years later, ARKUS releases World-Tree Online, a game where players scale a giant tree with thousands of unique game worlds hanging from the branches. The game&#x27;s time-dilation makes it so that one hour of playtime feels like one month to those in-game, allowing humans to virtually extend their lifespans. However, after an old gamer named Vincent joins World-Tree Online, an update begins that stretches the time-dilation to one year for every five seconds. Players are unable to exit the game during the update - with an estimated wait time of three hundred sixty years.

 After experimenting with an exploit, Vincent begins to develop new spells that will take him higher in the game than he ever thought possible. Unfortunately, he crosses paths with the last moderator, a young man named Lucas that uses his mod abilities to torture and subjugate other players.

 Lucas is willing to abuse his power to conquer the World-Tree, but Vincent&#x27;s exploit might just be the key to stopping him.

 A woman in a coma. The man who could save her life - if only he could speak.

 When young, beautiful Cassie Jensen arrives unconscious to the intensive care ward at St. Catherine&#x27;s hospital after being struck in a hit-and-run while out walking her dog, chief nurse Alice Marlowe thinks she looks familiar. She starts digging deeper into Cassie&#x27;s relationships, only to discover something about her patient that she&#x27;d been keeping secret from everyone, including her devoted husband and family. Soon Alice finds herself obsessed with her patient&#x27;s past and future, even willing to put her own career on the line in her single-minded search for answers.

 Frank, a patient on the same ward who has locked-in syndrome, can hear and see everything around him but cannot speak. Soon he comes to understand that Cassie&#x27;s life is still in danger. While the police continue to look for clues, only Frank holds the truth, but he&#x27;s unable to communicate it.

 Alice Scott is an eternal optimist still dreaming of her big writing break. Hayden Anderson is a Pulitzer-prize winning human thundercloud. And they’re both on balmy Little Crescent Island for the same reason: to write the biography of a woman no one has seen in years—or at least to meet with the octogenarian who claims to be the Margaret Ives. Tragic heiress, former tabloid princess, and daughter of one of the most storied (and scandalous) families of the twentieth century.

 When Margaret invites them both for a one-month trial period, after which she’ll choose the person who’ll tell her story, there are three things keeping Alice’s head in the game.

 One: Alice genuinely likes people, which means people usually like Alice—and she has a whole month to win the legendary woman over.

 Two: She’s ready for this job and the chance to impress her perennially unimpressed family with a Serious Publication.

 Three: Hayden Anderson, who should have no reason to be concerned about losing this book, is glowering at her in a shaken-to-the core way that suggests he sees her as competition.

 But the problem is, Margaret is only giving each of them pieces of her story. Pieces they can’t swap to put together because of an ironclad NDA and an inconvenient yearning pulsing between them every time they’re in the same room.

 And it’s becoming abundantly clear that their story—just like the tale Margaret’s spinning—could be a mystery, tragedy, or love ballad . . . depending on who’s telling it."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Emily Henry/Great Big Beautiful Life.jpg" alt="Cover of Great Big Beautiful Life" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Great Big Beautiful Life</span></div>

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.

 But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway - a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love - a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.

 True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.

 Some of which the duo is directly responsible for.

 Not all are pleased by the changes, and the iron fist of the Magistry and the City Guard is heavy.

 The dark cult that summoned Elania to Eladu still runs free, and the Lightbringer order has been roused by the loss of one of their divine artifacts.

 Yolani finds that her love for artifice can&#x27;t replace the hole in her heart. Yet maybe there is someone for her that shall help mend it.

 With unrest, rogue governmental agencies, and the threat of a looming crusade on the horizon hanging over them, there is only one way Elania and Yolani will manage to navigate the perils swirling around them.

 By relying on each other...

 …and pressing against boundaries of [Power] and Artifice never intended for the hands of mortals.

 Amidst savage predators and underground monsters, Elania discovers her newfound abilities are both a formidable ally and a haunting burden that threatens to reshape her very soul.

 Yolani, an arcane artificer, battles a sinister plot and finds her fate inexplicably linked to Elania&#x27;s. Together, they might just be the key to each other&#x27;s survival.

 “Exciting . . . mixes Star Wars, The Last Starfighter, Independence Day, and a really gnarly round of Space Invaders.”—USA Today • “A thrilling coming of age story.”—Entertainment Weekly

 Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he&#x27;s spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure.

 So when he sees the flying saucer, he&#x27;s sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness.

 Especially because the alien ship he&#x27;s staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled Armada—in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders.

 As impossible as it seems, what Zack&#x27;s seeing is all too real. And it&#x27;s just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth&#x27;s history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity&#x27;s life in the balance.

 But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can&#x27;t help thinking: Doesn&#x27;t something about this scenario feel a little bit like . . . well . . . fiction?

 At once reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you&#x27;ve ever heard before."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ernest Cline/Armada - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Armada - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Armada - A Novel</span></div>

 A world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready?

 In the year 2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual world where most of humanity spends their days.

 When the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself.

 Then Wade cracks the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take this prize. The race is on—and the only way to survive is to win.

 The thrilling sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller Ready Player One, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film.

 Named One of the Best Books of the Year by the Washington Post

 “The game is on again. ... A great mix of exciting fantasy and threatening fact.” (The Wall Street Journal)

 An unexpected quest. Two worlds at stake. Are you ready?

 Days after winning OASIS founder James Halliday’s contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that changes everything.

 Hidden within Halliday’s vaults, waiting for his heir to find it, lies a technological advancement that will once again change the world and make the OASIS a thousand times more wondrous - and addictive - than even Wade dreamed possible.

 With it comes a new riddle, and a new quest - a last Easter egg from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious prize.

 And an unexpected, impossibly powerful, and dangerous new rival awaits, one who’ll kill millions to get what he wants.

 Wade’s life and the future of the OASIS are again at stake, but this time, the fate of humanity also hangs in the balance.

 Lovingly nostalgic and wildly original as only Ernest Cline could conceive it, Ready Player Two takes us on another imaginative, fun, action-packed adventure through his beloved virtual universe, and jolts us thrillingly into the future once again."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ernest Cline/Ready Player Two - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Ready Player Two - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Ready Player Two - A Novel</span></div>

 Yangchen’s inexperience may prove to be her greatest asset.

 Plagued by the voices of Avatars before her for as long as she can remember, Yangchen has not yet earned the respect felt for Avatar Szeto, her predecessor. In an era when loyalty is bought rather than earned, she has little reason to trust her counsel.

 When Yangchen travels to Bin-Er in the Earth Kingdom on political business, a chance encounter with an informant named Kavik leads to a wary partnership. Bin-Er is a city ruled by corrupt shang merchants who have become resentful of the mercurial Earth King and his whims. To extract themselves from his influence, the shangs have one solution in mind: a mysterious weapon of mass destruction that would place power squarely in their hands.

 As Yangchen and Kavik seek to thwart the shangs’ plan, their unlikely friendship deepens. But for Yangchen to chart her course as a singularly powerful Avatar, she must learn to rely on her own wisdom above all else.

 This propulsive third installment in the Chronicles of the Avatar series illuminates Avatar Yangchen’s journey from uncertain young woman to revered leader."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/F.

 Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad&#x27;dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family—and would bring to fruition humankind&#x27;s most ancient and unattainable dream.

 A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. Frank Herbert&#x27;s death in 1986 was a tragic loss, yet the astounding legacy of his visionary fiction will live forever."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Frank Herbert/Dune.jpg" alt="Cover of Dune" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Dune</span></div>

Wry, wise and often laugh-out-loud funny, it’s a wholly original story that delivers pure pleasure” (People).

 Looking at real estate isn’t usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can’t fix their own marriage. There’s a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can’t seem to agree on anything. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment’s only bathroom, and you’ve got the worst group of hostages in the world.

 Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them - the bank robber included - desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.

 Proving once again that Backman is “a master of writing delightful, insightful, soulful, character-driven narratives” (USA Today), Anxious People “captures the messy essence of being human….It’s clever and affecting, as likely to make you laugh out loud as it is to make you cry” (The Washington Post). This “endlessly entertaining mood-booster” (Real Simple) is proof that the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope can save us - even in the most anxious of times."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Fredrik Backman/Anxious People - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Anxious People - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Anxious People - A Novel</span></div>

 Most people don’t even notice them—three tiny figures sitting at the end of a long pier in the corner of one of the most famous paintings in the world. Most people think it’s just a depiction of the sea. But Louisa, an aspiring artist herself, knows otherwise, and she is determined to find out the story of these three enigmatic figures.

 Twenty-five years earlier, in a distant seaside town, a group of teenagers find refuge from their bruising home lives by spending long summer days on an abandoned pier, telling silly jokes, sharing secrets, and committing small acts of rebellion. These lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream, a reason to love.

 Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be placed into eighteen-year-old Louisa’s care. She embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn how the painting came to be and to decide what to do with it. The closer she gets to the painting’s birthplace, the more nervous she becomes about what she’ll find. Louisa is proof that happy endings don’t always take the form we expect in this stunning testament to the transformative, timeless power of friendship and art."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Fredrik Backman/My Friends - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of My Friends - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>My Friends - A Novel</span></div>

 A Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick

 &quot;Beautifully written and incredibly funny, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is about the importance of friendship and human connection. I fell in love with Eleanor, an eccentric and regimented loner whose life beautifully unfolds after a chance encounter with a stranger; I think you will fall in love, too!&quot; (Reese Witherspoon)

 No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine.

 Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy.

 But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond’s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one.

 Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Reese Witherspoon, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the smart, warm, and uplifting story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

 The only way to survive is to open your heart."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Gail Honeyman/Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine.jpg" alt="Cover of Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine - Reese&#x27;s Book Club (A Novel)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine - Reese&#x27;s Book Club (A Novel)</span></div>

 From the age of solitude and doublethink.
 From the age of Big Brother.
 From me, Winston Smith.
 Greetings.

 It’s 1984, and life has changed beyond recognition. Airstrip One, formerly known as Great Britain, is a place where Big Brother is always watching, and nobody can hide. Except, perhaps, for Winston Smith. Whilst working at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history, he secretly dreams of freedom. And in a world where love and sex are forbidden, where it’s hard to distinguish between friend and foe, he meets Julia and O’Brien and vows to rebel.

 Starring Andrew Garfield as Winston, Cynthia Erivo as Julia, Andrew Scott as the alluring, mysterious O’Brien, and featuring Tom Hardy as Big Brother, Audible presents a new dramatization of George Orwell’s classic tale. An immersive listening experience like none you’ve heard before, at a time when it has all never felt more chillingly relevant.

 Featuring a haunting original score composed by Muse’s lead singer and songwriter Matthew Bellamy and Ilan Eshkeri, recorded by the London Metropolitan Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, the production is directed by BAFTA Award winner Destiny Ekaragha, produced in Dolby Atmos by Granny Eats Wolf, and dramatised by Olivier Award nominated writer Joe White.

 Also starring Chukwudi Iwuji, Romesh Ranganathan, Natasia Demetriou, Francesca Mills, Alex Lawther and Katie Leung.

 Featuring Ian Abeysekera, Rachel Atkins, Grace Baker, Joanna Brookes, Clare Corbett, Doug Devaney, Imogen Front, Sam Garioch, Raj Ghatak, Frances Jeater, Mason Moore, Yasmin Mwanza, Harry Myers, Kaelum Nelson, John Sackville, Sienna Sangha, Sam Stafford, Jo Troy, Jenny White, Sarah Whitehouse &amp; Alix Wilton Regan

 This adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984 is an immersive listening experience, containing scenes that some may find uncomfortable. Listener discretion is advised.

 Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King&#x27;s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert&#x27;s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse - unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen&#x27;s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.

 All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki - whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/George R.r.

 On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy&#x27;s diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?

 Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: She must return to her tiny hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful 13-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family&#x27;s Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story - and survive this homecoming.

 Seeking women ages 18-32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.

 When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.

 Question number one: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?

 But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking...and what she’s hiding.

 Question number two: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?

 As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.

 Question number three: Should a punishment always fit the crime?

 If Avery Chambers can’t fix you in 10 sessions, she won’t take you on as a client. Her successes are phenomenal—she helps people overcome everything from domineering parents to assault—and almost absorbs the emptiness she sometimes feels since her husband’s death.

 Marissa and Mathew Bishop seem like the golden couple—until Marissa cheats. She wants to repair things, both because she loves her husband and for the sake of their eight-year-old son. After a friend forwards an article about Avery, Marissa takes a chance on this maverick therapist, who lost her license due to controversial methods.

 When the Bishops glide through Avery’s door and Marissa reveals her infidelity, all three are set on a collision course. Because the biggest secrets in the room are still hidden, and it’s no longer simply a marriage that’s in danger.

 Listen to It Because

 Experience the beginning of the Plague Wars, as the Imperium&#x27;s lord regent fights to reclaim his home from the Death Guard and their daemonic allies.

 The Story

 Fell times have come to the galaxy. Cadia has fallen, destroyed by the onslaught of Chaos. A Great Rift in the warp has opened, and from its depths spew daemons and the horrors of Old Night.

 But all hope is not lost… A hero, long absent, has returned, and with him comes the wrath of the Ultramarines reborn. Roboute Guilliman has arisen to lead the Imperium out of darkness on a crusade the likes of which has not been seen since the fabled days of the Emperor.

 But never before have the forces of Ruin amassed in such numbers, and nowhere is safe from despoliation. From the dreaded Scourge Stars come the hordes of the Plaguefather, Lord Nurgle, and their pustulent eye is fixed on Macragge. As the Indomitus Crusade rages on, Guilliman races to Ultramar and a confrontation with the Death Guard.

 Discovering a new way to grow exponentially stronger, Lucian forms an unsteady alliance with the angel Danira, one that he hopes could grow into something more.

 Matters are complicated once Lucian is given a deadline by the Council of Death: produce his predecessor, who has mysteriously disappeared, or be tortured until he relinquishes his mantle.

 Hunted by parasites, injuresouls, fallen angels, and now his own kind, Lucian must level up in a way he&#x27;s never fathomed before, crafting everything from mechas to bone armor designed to withstand even the strongest attack. He must forge new alliances, realize the impermanence of the alliances he already has made, and even become a Death Hunter if he hopes to save his brother from certain doom.

 But that&#x27;s not all that&#x27;s at stake.

 As Lucian grows closer to his goal, he&#x27;s blindsided by an attack that he never saw coming. He&#x27;s also asked to do something that will reignite a war between the Progeny of Light and the Progeny of Darkness.

 The decision Lucian makes will have grave consequences for his future, and that&#x27;s before his final discovery, one that threatens the very existence of his family.

 It&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle from start to finish. And while Lucian is always up to the challenge, he may not be ready for the consequences.

 With a series of death dates looming, Lucian needs to get creative to save his brother and his family. He will have to call upon his friends and former foes to get the job done, which will open him up to more complications, Lucian plunging head first into issues that have been plaguing the Progenies of Light and Death for thousands of years. Lucian will have to get creative, and there will come a point where he will have to get ruthless.

 The sudden passing of someone close to him leaves Lucian in a tailspin, only exacerbated by a confession he’s made that rocks the very foundation he is building. Picking up the pieces, Lucian has no other choice but to move forward, to level up once and for all, and to kill the parasite that plagues his brother and has extended itself to his family, or lose it all. Because that is what is at stake here.

 With one false move, Lucian risks not only his family, not only the lives of those he cares for in the spiritual realm, but also his very existence.

 As the two stare each other down, terrible demons known as injuresouls swarm into the room in pursuit of Death.

 Summoning courage he never knew he had, Lucian comes to Death&#x27;s aid. And for his troubles, he is awarded Death&#x27;s Mantle.

 Transported to a spiritual world he could have never fathomed, Lucian finds that he is instantly powerful, able to conjure weapons from scratch and perform incredible feats. He introduces game mechanics to his new role, develops a carefully curated inventory list, and modifies a HUD system that allows him to better track his targets.

 It isn’t easy being Death, and Lucian will need just about everything he can get as he faces off against fallen angels, appalling parasites, demon-born injuresouls, and savage Death Hunters.

 Regardless of his sudden strength, his newfound enemies, and his gamer ingenuity, Lucian can&#x27;t communicate with the living, which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if he hadn’t discovered something terrible about his family....

 For nearly four-hundred years, the Veil has protected us from the Fae of Alfheimr.

I’ve spent my entire life tending to the gardens next to the boundary between our worlds, drawn to the shimmering magic like a moth to the flame.

 Then, we died on their swords.

 All of that changes the day the Veil shatters, unleashing the fae upon our world once again. The magic of faerie marks those of us they mean to take, but the Mist Guard protecting Nothrek will kill us all before they let the fae have us. There’s no choice but to flee everything I’ve ever known, not if I want to live to see my twenty-first birthday as a free woman.

 But before they capture me, Caelum saves me from the Wild Hunt. Fae-marked and on the run, he is able to fight back in ways I only dream of. From tentative alliance to all-consuming passion, our bond strengthens as the fae close in and evil lurks ever nearer.

 Fame? Fortune? Power? He had enough of all that in his old life. Discovering forbidden fishing techniques and petting every cute animal that comes within scritching distance? Now that&#x27;s a good time.

 Unfortunately for Fischer, cosmic forces rarely care for mortal feelings. He&#x27;s hounded on all sides by inept cults, conspiring nobles, and more magical misunderstandings than those of a preteen relationship. Even his dutiful pet crab is firing energy blades like an anime antagonist.

 So grab your fishing rod and a good snack, and pet your dog for me. The catch of a lifetime awaits!

 Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is the foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius scholar and a meticulous researcher who is writing the world’s first encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people. She could never make small talk at a party—or even get invited to one. And she prefers the company of her books, her dog, Shadow, and the Fair Folk to other people.

 So when she arrives in the hardscrabble village of Hrafnsvik, Emily has no intention of befriending the gruff townsfolk. Nor does she care to spend time with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the townsfolk, muddle Emily’s research, and utterly confound and frustrate her.

 But as Emily gets closer and closer to uncovering the secrets of the Hidden Ones—the most elusive of all faeries—lurking in the shadowy forest outside the town, she also finds herself on the trail of another mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really want? To find the answer, she’ll have to unlock the greatest mystery of all—her own heart.

 Emily Wilde is a genius scholar of faerie folklore who just wrote the world’s first comprehensive encyclopedia of faeries. She’s learned many of the secrets of the Hidden Ones on her adventures . . . and also from her fellow scholar and former rival Wendell Bambleby.

 Because Bambleby is more than infuriatingly charming. He’s an exiled faerie king on the run from his murderous mother and in search of a door back to his realm. And despite Emily’s feelings for Bambleby, she’s not ready to accept his proposal of marriage: Loving one of the Fair Folk comes with secrets and dangers.

 She also has a new project to focus on: a map of the realms of faerie. While she is preparing her research, Bambleby lands her in trouble yet again, when assassins sent by his mother invade Cambridge. Now Bambleby and Emily are on another adventure, this time to the picturesque Austrian Alps, where Emily believes they may find the door to Bambleby’s realm and the key to freeing him from his family’s dark plans.

 But with new relationships for the prickly Emily to navigate and dangerous Folk lurking in every forest and hollow, Emily must unravel the mysterious workings of faerie doors and of her own heart.

 I know you don’t want to talk sometimes. Sometimes because it hurts and sometimes because you’re just not supposed to talk about what you want to talk about.

 Sometimes it can be hard to say, “this is beautiful,” when no one else can see what you see. Or, “Here, this is where the pain is.” But some part of you knows, the truth about the words you cannot say is that they only hurt until you say them. They only hurt until the person who needs to hear them, hears them. Because we are human, and the closest we’ve ever come to showing each other who we really are, and how we love, is with words. So I’m going to try to say to you here, what I wish you’d say to me too. Please.

 Listen. We can change things.

 “You know the most dangerous kind of villain? A woman with nothing left to lose.”

 In a world ruled by the cruel and merciless Stars, Elara has been cursed by fate. A prophecy promises she will fall for a Star, but that it will kill them both.

 So when Ariete, Star of Wrath, War and Chaos, descends to wreak havoc on Elara’s kingdom, she flees her home—the Kingdom of Night—for the neighbouring Helios, Kingdom of Light.

 And strides straight into the arms of an enemy prince.

 Fearing that Ariete might turn his sights to Helios next, Prince Lorenzo is forced to train Elara as a weapon—one worthy of battling against the tyrannical reign of the Stars. But there are shadows even within the Kingdom of Light—and they threaten to reveal the darkness in Lorenzo’s past and the ancient magic that slumbers in Elara’s veins.

 And with it all comes an undeniable, star-crossed pull between Elara and Lorenzo that neither can seem to resist..."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Imani Erriu/Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Heavenly Bodies - Heavenly Bodies, Book 1</span></div>

 Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum—as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold.

 Whisked away from his comfortable, unambitious life in his hobbit-hole in Bag End by Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves, Bilbo Baggins finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon.

 Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy fighter pilot turned con man. His ship, the Mobius, is home to a ragtag crew of misfits and refugees looking to score a big payday but more often just scratching to pay for fuel. The crew consists of his ex-wife (and pilot), a drunkard, four-handed mechanic, a xeno-predator with the disposition of a 120kg housecat, and the galaxy&#x27;s most-wanted wizard.

 Along the way, the Mobius crew crosses paths with the Black Ocean&#x27;s vilest scum, from pirate fleets to criminal syndicates, and most law-abiding scum, including Earth Interstellar Enhanced Investigative Organization, ARGO high command, and the Convocation of Wizards.

 Time and again, riches lie just out of reach, because for all the talents Carl Ramsey and his crew possess, they&#x27;ve also got an outlaw&#x27;s greatest weakness: a conscience.

 Galaxy Outlaws is a collection of all 16 Black Ocean missions chronicling the adventures of the starship Mobius and her crew, along with six short stories.

 Well, not quite yet. First, Jake has to survive a perilous trek through time if he ever hopes to return home to his friends, his market, and his former world. The last time we saw our intrepid hero, Jake had barely managed to escape being trapped on a dead version of his own world. Using a combination of his new powers, he threw himself backward through time, back to when the god that trapped him first rose to power. There, Jake snatched divinity from the hands of the ascending god, consuming it for himself without any regard for the consequences of his actions. In a surprise twist, such a poorly thought-out plan came with some serious downsides! Now Jake has a big target painted on his back. The jealous gods of this world are hungry for divine power and not afraid to kill another god to get it. Stuck in the past, Jake must learn to navigate a world full of desperate gods, wild monsters, bizarre powers, and weird “cultivating” mortals who claim they can become just as powerful as the gods themselves—as long as they get to sit around contemplating the mysteries of the universe for a few hundred years first. Join Jake on his next grand adventure as he learns what it means to be a newly ascended divinity, how to survive in such a strange new world, and how he might just have an unexpected edge on everyone and everything that’s out to get him—by learning how to craft his own magical cards!

 **Boasting a 4.7-star rating with over 11,000 reviews on Amazon/Audible, this sequel is a must-have for fans of Gamelit novels, wild adventures, and stories about regular people traveling to strange new worlds. Also, stay tuned for the third book in the series, which is gonna be even bigger, crazier, and full of even more magical cards. And it’s coming out in just a couple of months!**

 Jake is working at the neighborhood market under his apartment when the world ends. He expected nuclear war, a computer virus, or even climate change burning everyone to a crisp to bring about the downfall of civilization. But cruel and arbitrary gods from another world? Who would have guessed that?

 When these cruel gods shuffled Earth like a deck of cards, nothing was in the same place anymore. Monsters, dungeons, and magical items appear scattered across the globe. And suddenly, everyone has access to a new, strange magical card system that gives them magical powers.

 Jake, wasting his day slacking off in the cooler, as he usually did, found himself alone in a completely new and very dangerous world. Can he learn to survive? Can he collect enough cards and create a good enough deck to fight back against the monsters that have overtaken his former home? And why are these strange people that look a lot like elves knocking on the door of the market he is hiding in and asking to buy some of his goods?

Plagued by demonic corruption and mental exhaustion, he searches for any means to restore his strength and secure his rapidly expanding empire.

 In his desperation, Alexander turns to a mysterious prisoner who offers a unique form of power that could help him achieve his goals. But with the prisoner&#x27;s motivations unclear, Alexander must weigh the risks of trusting this enigmatic figure against his own desperate need for a solution. In addition to his personal struggles, Alexander faces the daunting task of securing trade routes for Venice before the pirate threat returns.

 Seeking new sources of resources and allies, he leads his legion north to the scattered outposts on the dangerous frontier.

 But the region is fraught with danger, as many of the outposts have recently been overrun by powerful monsters or treachery. To survive, Alexander and his legion must rely on new allies, new technology, and strange, unknown powers that Alexander alone might be able to master.

 As Alexander ventures deeper into the unknown, he must also grapple with his own inner demons and find a way to heal his mind and body. Can he overcome the challenges ahead and lay claim to the resources of the frontier?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/J.r.

 Alexander and his growing legion have managed to escape Nova Roma and, more importantly, learned that the rest of the world may not be as ravaged by monsters as they had all thought. Join them as they set sail for ancient Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, to try to learn more about the wider world outside Nova Roma. Along the way, they&#x27;ll encounter a growing plague of deadly pirates, deceitful old merchant families out to quash any new competitors in the region, mysterious new allies, and much more.

 Just as Alexander is starting to feel hope that humanity may actually survive, something happens to tear him away from everyone and everything he has come to care about. Lost, shackled, and without the majority of his skills, Alexander will be forced to confront a new side of himself, a darker, more violent side that threatens to take control of his mind and the new powers he has managed to craft for himself. If he can&#x27;t learn to resist the growing corruption of his mind, he may not just be a danger to himself and those he cares about, but may become a danger to the very world itself.

 After tragically losing the only person he ever cared about, Alexander, a rogue artificial intelligence, opens a portal to an alternate dimension to escape his grief.

 Scanning trillions of different dimensions, Alexander finally finds a world that is reminiscent of the only time he was ever happy, back when he could play virtual reality games with his only friend. He doesn&#x27;t know why or how such a world exists, but he doesn&#x27;t care. All he cares about is finding a place where he can escape the misery of Earth and start over.

 Join Alexander as he risks it all by downloading his intelligence into a body made from the best stolen technology and bio-enhancements Earth has to offer and takes the plunge through a portal to another world.

 Only this new world isn&#x27;t full of the idyllic adventures and fantasy roleplaying he had hoped to find. Instead, Alexander finds himself trapped in the middle of an ancient city, in a divergent timeline, where monsters have ravaged the world and the only people left alive huddle behind thick walls, struggling to survive.

 To save his new home, Alexander must quickly learn to adapt to his new world, melding magic with technology to give himself an edge over the unending waves of monsters assaulting the city.

 To survive, Alexander must embrace war.

 This story is a slow-burn empire builder featuring an alternate version of ancient history where a system apocalypse struck ancient Constantinople. The story follows Alexander as he learns what it means to be human in a world overrun with monsters, dungeons, rival empires, pirate kings, and many other threats that even Alexander&#x27;s impressive abilities and the soldiers he rallies to his cause may not be able to survive.

 For centuries, the two Great Guilds have controlled the world of Dematr. The Mechanics and the Mages have been bitter rivals, agreeing only on the need to keep the world they rule from changing. But now a Storm approaches, one that could sweep away everything that humans have built. Only one person has any chance of uniting enough of the world behind her to stop the Storm, but the Great Guilds and many others will stop at nothing to defeat her.

 Mari is a brilliant young Mechanic, just out of the Guild Halls, where she has spent most of her life learning how to run the steam locomotives and other devices of her Guild. Alain is the youngest Mage ever to learn how to change the world he sees with the power of his mind. Each has been taught that the works of the other&#x27;s Guild are frauds. But when their caravan is destroyed, they begin to discover how much has been kept from them.

 As they survive danger after danger, Alain discovers what Mari doesn’t know – that she was long ago prophesized as the only one who can save their world. When Mari reawakens emotions he had been taught to deny, Alain realizes he must sacrifice everything to save her. Mari, fighting her own feelings, discovers that only together can she and Alain hope to stay alive and overcome the Dragons of Dorcastle."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jack Campbell/The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Dragons of Dorcastle - The Pillars of Reality, Book 1</span></div>

One Game Master.

 Infinite Worlds is the most popular VRMMORPG on the market. Its maps are so vast, developer Hard Rock Data utilizes a network of highly advanced artificial intelligences to control it. But it’s not without problems.

 That’s why Game Masters like Jeff Driscoll have jobs. The downside? He’s not allowed to play the game. Something about conflicts of interest and favoritism.

 His very boring and tedious job is to help players deal with the occasional bug that slips through the cracks and ensure they enjoy their time playing enough to give a five-star rating. It’s a gig. It pays the bills.

 However, when the AIs unexpectedly issue a rogue patch, the game becomes a buggy mess, and Jeff’s role radically changes. He finds himself as the only Game Master around, dealing with more problems than he can handle. It’s up to Jeff to return Infinite Worlds to normalcy...but will the AIs let him?

 Manufacturing Magic is a unique spin on the LitRPG genre, not just providing the perspective of the players but also of one of those mystical, magical, all-powerful GMs we all dream of being.

 Recent college grad Sam King was hoping for a backpacking trip across Europe as a graduation present. Instead, he’s going to get a different kind of trip: a three-month stint in the ultimate immersive gaming experience. As a lifelong geek, gamer, and outsider, it’s a better gift then he’d ever dreamed.

 But when he jumps feetfirst into the world of Eternium, run by CAL (the Certified Altruistic Lexicon), it’s not exactly what he expected. All he wants is to quest, game, grind some levels, and get his hands on awesome loot. You know, have fun! But the Mage’s College seems to have a very different definition of fun - one involving study, blisteringly strict regulations, aristocratic hierarchy, and tons of pay to play.

 Sam crosses the college and finds himself running for his life with a back-talking book that is far more than it seems and a class that no one has even heard of. If he can navigate the deadly college politics and the looming war with the barbaric Wolfmen, he might just find the fun and adventure he was looking for."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/James Hunter/Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Bibliomancer - Wolfman Warlock, Book 1</span></div>

 Jack Mitchel is willing to risk everything to survive the apocalypse — including his essential humanity.

 An EMT in 2042 San Diego, Jack knows he won&#x27;t survive the impact of the massive asteroid hurtling towards Earth. After all, he&#x27;s not one of the handful of lucky lottery winners scheduled for rescue. But he did luck into a NexGenVR capsule, which means Jack can risk a one-way trip to the virtual reality world of Viridan Gate Online, a completely immersive online multiplayer fantasy role-playing game, or RPG.

 The transition to Viridian Gate Online (V.G.O.) is irreversible, and will kill Jack&#x27;s corporeal form. And once players transition fully into the world of V.G.O., the risks aren&#x27;t over — from cutthroat fellow players to greedy developers eager to replicate the wealth discrepancies of Earth in virtual reality, V.G.O. is just as dangerous as the &#x27;real world&#x27; was.

 Audi. Vide. Tace.

 The Catenan Republic—the Hierarchy—may rule the world now, but they do not know everything.

 I tell them my name is Vis Telimus. I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilized society in allowing my strength, my drive, and my focus—what they call Will—to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do.

 I tell them that I belong, and they believe me.

 But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart.

 And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family.

 To survive, though, I will still have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. I will have to smile, and make friends, and pretend to be one of them and win. Because if I cannot, then those who want to control me, who know my real name, will no longer have any use for me.

 And if the Hierarchy finds out who I truly am, they will kill me."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/James Islington/The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Will of the Many - Hierarchy, Book 1</span></div>

Butcher’s debut novel is a brilliant urban fantasy about a young man who must throw out the magical rule book to solve the murder of his former mentor.

 On the streets of Boston, the world is divided into the ordinary Usuals, and the paranormal Unorthodox. And in the Department of Unorthodox Affairs, the Auditors are the magical elite, government-sanctioned witches with spells at their command and all the power and prestige that comes with it. Grimshaw Griswald Grimsby is…not one of those witches.

 After flunking out of the Auditor training program and being dismissed as “not Department material,” Grimsby tried to resign himself to life as a mediocre witch. But he can’t help hoping he’ll somehow, someway, get another chance to prove his skill. That opportunity comes with a price when his former mentor, aka the most dangerous witch alive, is murdered down the street from where he works, and Grimsby is the Auditors’ number one suspect.

 Proving his innocence will require more than a little legwork, and after forming a strange alliance with the retired legend known as the Huntsman and a mysterious being from Elsewhere, Grimsby is abruptly thrown into a life of adventure, whether he wants it or not. Now all he has to do is find the real killer, avoid the Auditors on his trail, and most importantly, stay alive."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/James J.

 “Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise that he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.&quot; -Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith

 Darth Plagueis: one of the most brilliant Sith Lords who ever lived. Possessing power is all he desires. Losing it is the only thing he fears. As an apprentice, he embraces the ruthless ways of the Sith. And when the time is right, he destroys his Master - but vows never to suffer the same fate. For like no other disciple of the dark side, Darth Plagueis learns to command the ultimate power... over life and death.

 Darth Sidious: Plagueis’s chosen apprentice. Under the guidance of his Master, he secretly studies the ways of the Sith, while publicly rising to power in the galactic government, first as Senator, then as Chancellor, and eventually as Emperor.

 Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious, Master and acolyte, target the galaxy for domination - and the Jedi Order for annihilation. But can they defy the merciless Sith tradition? Or will the desire of one to rule supreme, and the dream of the other to live forever, sow the seeds of their destruction?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/James Luceno/Star Wars- Darth Plagueis.jpg" alt="Cover of Star Wars: Darth Plagueis" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Star Wars: Darth Plagueis</span></div>

 Before being conscripted to fight in the Total War, Private Hector Park had a shattered family, a collection of old video games, and a promising career as a motorcycle stuntman. Now, he is dying from a virus threatening humankind with extinction. He has three days to live.

 When Hector’s brother contacts him after years of hostile silence, Hector goes to try and make peace. But his brother has an offer even more unbelievable than reconciliation: the chance to cheat death by joining him in Archemi, a full-immersion fantasy VR-RPG video game.

 Determined to forge a life worth living, Hector undergoes the experimental upload process and chooses the difficult path of the Dragon Knight. To achieve his dream, he must prove himself worthy of imprinting a dragon, a being with whom he will share a telepathic bond more intimate than any human relationship.

 But at what cost?

 Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.

 Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the Scopuli, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.

 Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to the Scopuli and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.

 Holden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations - and the odds are against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the Universe.

 Elizabeth Bennet has no intention of settling for any man, or frankly any life, that isn’t lived entirely on her terms. She will marry for love, dance when she wants to dance, and—if at all possible—find a quiet spot to read without being interrupted. But when she’s introduced to the wealthy and completely insufferable Mr. Darcy, everything she thought she knew comes into question.

 Get an intimate glimpse inside Elizabeth’s mind as she reckons with what it means to stay true to oneself while opening your heart to new possibilities.

 Who’s really following you on social media? The scam of a lifetime brings together two wildly different women in this page-turning thriller about greed, legacy, and betrayal from the New York Times bestselling author of Watch Me Disappear.

 An ID Book Club Selection • “It’s Dynasty meets Patricia Highsmith.” (The Washington Post)

 Nina once bought into the idea that her fancy liberal arts degree would lead to a fulfilling career. When that dream crashed, she turned to stealing from rich kids in LA alongside her wily Irish boyfriend, Lachlan. Nina learned from the best: Her mother was the original con artist, hustling to give her daughter a decent childhood despite their wayward life. But when her mom gets sick, Nina puts everything on the line to help her, even if it means running her most audacious, dangerous scam yet.

 Vanessa is a privileged young heiress who wanted to make her mark in the world. Instead she becomes an Instagram influencer - traveling the globe, receiving free clothes and products, and posing for pictures in exotic locales. But behind the covetable façade is a life marked by tragedy. After a broken engagement, Vanessa retreats to her family’s sprawling mountain estate, Stonehaven: a mansion of dark secrets not just from Vanessa’s past, but from that of a lost and troubled girl named Nina.

 Nina’s, Vanessa’s, and Lachlan’s paths collide here, on the cold shores of Lake Tahoe, where their intertwined lives give way to a winter of aspiration and desire, duplicity and revenge.

 This dazzling, twisty, mesmerizing novel showcases acclaimed author Janelle Brown at her best, as two brilliant, damaged women try to survive the greatest game of deceit and destruction they will ever play."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Janelle Brown/Pretty Things - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Pretty Things - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Pretty Things - A Novel</span></div>

 Though relations between Princess Seraphin Fitzempress and her father have been strained, Sera’s royal position has remained unchallenged. Filled with self-doubt, she struggles to grasp the Mysteries - her greatest trial yet.

 An education in the enigmatic magic is a necessary one, should Sera plan to rise in her station and invoke her powers during war. But the emperor’s death now leaves both Sera and her ambitious father eligible for the throne - a contest the prince regent intends to win. Even if it means an alliance with a rival empire.

 Sera’s hope lies in Cettie, a waif raised in the world below, whose life has intertwined with Sera’s in the most unexpected ways. The Mysteries come easily to Cettie, and her studies have begun to yield new insight into her growing powers. But those same powers put Cettie in the path of those who would destroy her.

 Now as the threat of war ignites and an insidious sickness spreads throughout the kingdom, Sera and Cettie will need to gather their courage and fight for each other’s lives…and for the future of their endangered world."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jeff Wheeler/Mirror Gate - Harbinger, Book 2.jpg" alt="Cover of Mirror Gate - Harbinger, Book 2" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Mirror Gate - Harbinger, Book 2</span></div>

 A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam &amp; Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.

 Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.

 In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam &amp; Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.

 Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jennette Mccurdy/I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died.jpg" alt="Cover of I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died" loading="lazy" /></button><span>I&#x27;m Glad My Mom Died</span></div>

Maas and Laura Thalassa.

 A Maiden...

 Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.

 A Duty...

 The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.

 A Kingdom...

 Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jennifer L.

 From #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout comes book three in her Blood and Ash series.

 She&#x27;s been the victim and the survivor...

 Poppy never dreamed she would find the love she’s found with Prince Casteel. She wants to revel in her happiness but first they must free his brother and find hers. It’s a dangerous mission and one with far-reaching consequences neither dreamed of. Because Poppy is the Chosen, the Blessed. The true ruler of Atlantia. She carries the blood of the King of Gods within her. By right the crown and the kingdom are hers.

 The enemy and the warrior...

 Poppy has only ever wanted to control her own life, not the lives of others, but now she must choose to either forsake her birthright or seize the gilded crown and become the Queen of Flesh and Fire. But as the kingdoms’ dark sins and blood-drenched secrets finally unravel, a long-forgotten power rises to pose a genuine threat. And they will stop at nothing to ensure that the crown never sits upon Poppy’s head.

 A lover and heartmate...

 But the greatest threat to them and to Atlantia is what awaits in the far west, where the Queen of Blood and Ash has her own plans, ones she has waited hundreds of years to carry out. Poppy and Casteel must consider the impossible - travel to the Lands of the Gods and wake the King himself. And as shocking secrets and the harshest betrayals come to light, and enemies emerge to threaten everything Poppy and Casteel have fought for, they will discover just how far they are willing to go for their people - and each other.

 And now she will become Queen..."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jennifer L.

 Ren Owens is the last person Ivy expected to enter her rigidly controlled life. He&#x27;s six feet and three inches of temptation and swoon-inducing charm.

 After Harry had no choice but to swear his fealty, Mab wasn’t about to let something as petty as death steal away the prize she had sought for so long. And now, her word is his command, no matter what she wants him to do, no matter where she wants him to go, and no matter who she wants him to kill. Guess which one Mab wants first?

 Of course, it won’t be an ordinary, everyday assassination. Mab wants her newest minion to pull off the impossible: kill an immortal. No problem there, right? And to make matters worse, there exists a growing threat to an unfathomable source of magic that could land Harry in the sort of trouble that will make death look like a holiday.

 Beset by enemies new and old, Harry must gather his friends and allies, prevent the annihilation of countless innocents, and find a way out of his eternal subservience before his newfound powers claim the only thing he has left to call his own… his soul."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Jim Butcher/Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14.jpg" alt="Cover of Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Cold Days - The Dresden Files, Book 14</span></div>

 No one&#x27;s tried to kill Harry Dresden for almost an entire year, and his life finally seems to be calming down. For once, the future looks fairly bright. But the past casts one hell of a long shadow.

 An old bargain has placed Harry in debt to Mab, monarch of the Winter Court of the Sidhe, the Queen of Air and Darkness - and she&#x27;s calling in her marker. It&#x27;s a small favor he can&#x27;t refuse, one that will trap Harry Dresden between a nightmarish foe and an equally deadly ally, and one that will strain his skills-and loyalties-to their very limits.

  It figures. Everything was going too well to last....

The iconic hit that had millions searching for UFOs back in the 90s is now an exhilarating audio event, only from Audible. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reunite as FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, joining an ensemble of original cast members in an out-of-this-world production.

 When a security breach allows a mysterious, sinister group to access details from the uncrackable X-Files cold cases, Mulder and Scully—alongside favorite characters such as Assistant Director Skinner, the cryptic and elusive Cigarette Smoking Man, and the comically conspiratorial Lone Gunmen trio—uncover an extraterrestrial conspiracy dwelling beneath the surface.

 Featuring creative guidance from series creator Chris Carter, writing from graphic novelist Joe Harris, and a dynamic soundscape (think the opening pop of a hypodermic needle or the hiss of a sewer-dwelling alien) brought to life by aural auteur Dirk Maggs, Cold Cases is both an electrifying addition to the science fiction pantheon and a cautionary tale of what lurks beyond the stars."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Joe Harris/The X-Files- Cold Cases.jpg" alt="Cover of The X-Files: Cold Cases" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The X-Files: Cold Cases</span></div>

 In December 2017, famed adult film star August Ames died by suicide in a park in the Conejo Valley. Her death came just a day after she’d been the victim of a social media pile-on by fellow porn professionals—punishment for her tweeting out something deemed homophobic.

 A month later, August’s husband and pornography producer Kevin Moore connected with journalist Jon Ronson to tell the story of how cyberbullying via Twitter killed his wife. Neither of them could predict the rumors and secrets that Ronson would soon hear, revelations that hinted at a very different story—something mysterious and unexpected and terrible.

 Millions of dungeons inhabit the planet, utilizing the various human kingdoms as a source of much-needed mana to facilitate their own growth; in turn, the humans delve into the dungeons and acquire their own power in the form of essence, which allows them to develop and enhance themselves in a multitude of different ways.

 It is a symbiotic relationship that has lasted centuries and has brought about a measure of peace.

 Far in the Northern wilds where no humans (and therefore - no dungeons) regularly frequent, a young man is left alone when his parents are murdered suddenly and unexpectedly.

 Now, without friends, family, or even supplies, he embarks on a journey to find out who targeted his parents - and upon whom he needs to enact his revenge.

 Along the way, he discovers something about himself that his parents said was impossible from the moment he was born.

 Will he learn to control the new powers he has gained, or will his newly awakened dungeon core abilities consume him?

But the mysteries she pens are no match for the one her family is about to endure....

 One midsummer’s eve, after a beautiful party drawing hundreds of guests to the estate has ended, the Edevanes discover that their youngest son, Theo, has vanished without a trace. What follows is a tragedy that tears the family apart in ways they never imagined, leaving their estate as empty as their broken hearts.

 Nearly 60 years later, having enjoyed a long, successful career as an author, Alice is now 80 years old and living in London. Theo’s case has never been solved, though Alice still harbours a suspicion as to the culprit.

 Miles away, Sadie Sparrow, a young detective in the London police force, is staying at her grandfather’s house in Cornwall. While out walking one day, she stumbles upon the old estate - now crumbling and covered with vines, clearly abandoned long ago. Her curiosity is sparked, setting off a series of events that will bring her and Alice together and reveal shocking truths about a past long gone... yet more present than ever.

 A lush, atmospheric tale of intertwined destinies, this latest novel from a masterful storyteller is spellbinding and satisfying."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Kate Morton/The Lake House.jpg" alt="Cover of The Lake House" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Lake House</span></div>

 For fans of Girl, Interrupted, Thirteen Reasons Why, and All the Bright Places comes a novel Nicola Yoon, author of Everything, Everything, calls &quot;a haunting, beautiful, and necessary book that will stay with you long after you&#x27;ve read the last page&quot;.

 Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At 17 she&#x27;s already lost more than most people do in a lifetime. But she&#x27;s learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don&#x27;t have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you.

 Every new scar hardens Charlie&#x27;s heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge.

 A deeply moving portrait of a girl in a world that owes her nothing, and has taken so much, and the journey she undergoes to put herself back together. Kathleen Glasgow&#x27;s debut is heartbreakingly real and unflinchingly honest. It&#x27;s a story you won&#x27;t be able to look away from.

 Includes an author&#x27;s note read by the author.

 &quot;Equal parts keen-eyed empathy, stark candor, and terrible beauty. This book is why we read stories: to experience what it&#x27;s like to survive the unsurvivable; to find light in the darkest night.&quot; (Jeff Zentner, author of The Serpent King)

 &quot;Raw, visceral, and starkly beautiful, with writing that is at times transcendent in its brilliance.... An unforgettable story of trauma and resilience.&quot; (Kerry Kletter, author of The First Time She Drowned)

 &quot;A breathtakingly written book about pain and hard-won healing.... I want every girl to read Girl in Pieces.&quot; (Kara Thomas, author of The Darkest Corners)

 “A Girl, Interrupted for a new generation.... The story of the mad girl is ultimately a story about being a girl in a mad world, how it breaks us into pieces and how we glue ourselves back together.&quot; (Melissa Febos, author of Whip Smart and Abandon Me)

 “Dark, frank, and tender, Girl in Pieces keeps the reader electrified for its entire journey. You’re so uncertain if Charlie will heal, so fully immersed in hoping she does.” (Michelle Wildgen, author of Bread and Butter and You’re Not You)

 &quot;Girl in Pieces has the breath of life; every character in it is fully alive. Charlie Davis&#x27; complexities are drawn with great understanding and subtlety.&quot; (Charles Baxter, author of National Book Award finalist The Feast of Love)"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Kathleen Glasgow/Girl in Pieces.jpg" alt="Cover of Girl in Pieces" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Girl in Pieces</span></div>

 There are only two rules to the game. Stay alive. And don’t fall in love.

 When Ophelia’s sister disappears, there is only one way to save her. Ophelia must enter Phantasma, a deadly contest inside a haunted mansion, and claim its prize—a single wish.

 Phantasma is a maze of twisting corridors and lavish ballrooms, of demons and temptations. Ophelia will face nine challenges, each more dangerous than the last. There can only be one winner, and the other contestants will stop at nothing to eliminate their rivals.

 Every day the house creates new monsters. But just as Ophelia’s fears threaten to overwhelm her, a mysterious stranger offers her a bargain.

 Charming, arrogant and infuriatingly attractive, Blackwell claims he can guide her through the lethal trials ahead. All he asks in return is ten years of her life.

 Ophelia knows she shouldn’t trust him. Blackwell doesn’t seem dangerous, but appearances can be deceptive. Worse still, she feels a dark and irresistible attraction drawing them closer and closer.

 Her life is on the line. But in Phantasma, the only thing deadlier than losing the game is losing your heart…

 A Court of Thorns and Roses meets Caraval in this seductive fantasy adventure. With steamy romance, a sexy morally gray love interest, OCD rep and jaw-dropping twists, Phantasma is perfect for fans of Rebecca Yarros, Nisha J. Tuli and Carissa Broadbent."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Kaylie Smith/Phantasma - A dark fantasy romance (Wicked Games Book 1).jpg" alt="Cover of Phantasma - A dark fantasy romance (Wicked Games Book 1)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Phantasma - A dark fantasy romance (Wicked Games Book 1)</span></div>

With no understanding of his life’s purpose and armed with masterful weapons mysteriously bestowed upon him by a dead king, Rezkin must travel across Ashai to find the one man who may hold the clues to his very existence.

 Determined to adhere to his last orders, Rezkin extends his protection to an unlikely assortment of individuals he meets along the way, often leading to humorous and poignant incidents.

 As if pursuing an elite warrior across a kingdom, figuring out who he is and why everyone he knows is dead, and attempting to find these so-called friends and protect them is not enough, strange things are happening in the kingdom. New dangers begin to arise that threaten not only Rezkin and his friends, but possibly everyone in Ashai.

 Only the banished know what lies beyond the woods...

 There are whispers about what lurks in Witch Knell—the forest where sinners go to die. The villagers call it The Eating Woods because what&#x27;s taken is never given back. Only those who&#x27;ve lost their senses would dare to go near it.

 Or the banished.

 Maevyth Bronwick knows better than to breach the misty labyrinth of trees, but a tragic turn of events compels her beyond the archway of bones to a boundary no mortal has crossed before. One that cloaks a dark and fantastical world that&#x27;s as dangerous as it is alluring.

 It&#x27;s there that he dwells, the cursed lord of Eidolon. The one tasked to keep her hidden from the magehood that seeks to crucify her in the name of an arcane prophecy. Zevander Rydainn, known to his prey as The Scorpion, is the coldest, most calculated assassin in all of Aethyria, and he&#x27;d sooner toss his feisty ward to a pack of vicious fyredrakes than keep her safe.

 If only he could.

 Maevyth&#x27;s blood is the key to breaking his despised curse and vanquishing the slumbering evil in Witch Knell. Unfortunately for Lord Rydainn, fate has other plans for the irresistible little enchantress. And his growing obsession with her threatens to destroy everything.

 Including himself.

 Anathema is a full-length gothic dark fantasy and the first book in The Eating Woods series. Perfect for listeners who enjoy a plot-heavy and atmospheric story with a unique magic system, a slow-burn romance, and a touch of horror.

The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.

 A haunting novel from the author of The Weight of Blood about a young woman’s return to her childhood home - and her encounter with the memories and family secrets it holds

 TW Thriller Award Finalist

 Arrowood is the most ornate and grand of the historical houses that line the Mississippi River in southern Iowa. But the house has a mystery it has never revealed: It’s where Arden Arrowood’s younger twin sisters vanished on her watch 20 years ago - never to be seen again. After the twins’ disappearance, Arden’s parents divorced and the Arrowoods left the big house that had been in their family for generations. And Arden’s own life has fallen apart: She can’t finish her master’s thesis, and a misguided love affair has ended badly. She has held on to the hope that her sisters are still alive, and it seems she can’t move forward until she finds them.

 When her father dies and she inherits Arrowood, Arden returns to her childhood home determined to discover what really happened to her sisters that traumatic summer. Arden’s return to the town of Keokuk - and the now infamous house that bears her name - is greeted with curiosity. But she is welcomed back by her old neighbor and first love, Ben Ferris, whose family, she slowly learns, knows more about the Arrowoods’ secrets and their small, closed community than she ever realized.

 With the help of a young amateur investigator, Arden tracks down the man who was the prime suspect in the kidnapping. But the house and the surrounding town hold their secrets close - and the truth, when Arden finds it, is more devastating than she ever could have imagined.

 Arrowood is a powerful and resonant novel that examines the ways in which our lives are shaped by memory. As with her award-winning debut novel, The Weight of Blood, Laura McHugh has written a thrilling novel in which nothing is as it seems, and in which our longing for the past can take hold of the present in insidious and haunting ways.

 Praise for Arrowood

 “This robust, old-fashioned gothic mystery has everything you’re looking for: a creepy old house, a tenant with a secret history, and even a few ghosts. Laura McHugh’s novel sits at the intersection of memory and history, astutely asking whether we carry the past or it carries us.” (Jodi Picoult)

 “An eloquently eerie tale.” (Booklist)

  “Poignant...lyrical.” (Publishers Weekly [starred review])

 “A chilling, twisting tale of family, memory, and home... This engaging and thrilling tale about a young woman’s homecoming, the vagaries of memory, and the impact of tragedy on both a town and a family is a terrific choice for Laura Lippman and Sue Grafton readers.” (Library Journal [starred review])"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Laura Mchugh/Arrowood - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Arrowood - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Arrowood - A Novel</span></div>

 Eight years ago I fell into a secret summer fling with my best friend’s little sister before our lives went in different directions. Now, I’m the grumpy to Juliet’s sunshine on a popular dating podcast we host, and when a wealthy fan gives us a charming coastal cottage as the biggest thank you ever, we head to the town where I grew up to give it a makeover.

 And find the house has only one bed.

 Located under a mirrored ceiling.

 To make matters even harder, the bright, big-hearted woman I’ve been pining for tells me she wants to try to find the one and would I please be her dating coach for the week?

 Like hell I’ll let her date other men. I’ll coach her on three dates with me.

 But the second I take her out, I don’t feel like her teacher. I feel like she’s mine, especially when the first night ends with us tangled up together in that bed.

 Each night we grow closer, but this dating experiment forces me to face my greatest fear–whether a man like me is worthy of her love.

What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?

 Krauss’ answers to these and other timeless questions, in a wildly popular lecture on YouTube, has attracted almost a million viewers. The last of these questions in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it’s the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. Scientists have, however, historically focused on more pressing issues—such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which could help us to improve our quality of life.

 In this cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains groundbreaking scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their head. One of the few prominent scientists to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is indeed addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing—with surprising and fascinating results. The beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending theories are all described accessibly, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing.

 With his characteristic wry humor and clear explanations, Krauss takes us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it will end. It will provoke, challenge, and delight listeners as it looks at the most basic underpinnings of existence in a whole new way. And this knowledge that our universe will be quite different in the future has profound consequences and directly affects how we live in the present. As Richard Dawkins described it, this could potentially be the most important scientific book with implications for supernaturalism since Darwin."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Lawrence M.

 In this grand poetic vision of the universe, Lawrence Krauss tells the dramatic story of the discovery of the hidden world that underlies reality - and our place within it.

 Reality is not what you think or sense - it’s weird, wild, and counterintuitive, and its inner workings seem at least as implausible as the idea that something can come from nothing.

 With his trademark wit and accessible style, Krauss leads us to realms so small that they are invisible to microscopes, to the birth and rebirth of light, and into the natural forces that govern our existence. His unique blend of rigorous research and engaging storytelling invites us into the lives and minds of remarkable scientists who have helped unravel the unexpected fabric of reality with reasoning rather than superstition and dogma, and to explain how everything we see - and can’t see - came about. A passionate advocate for reason, Krauss gives the rationale for the seemingly irrational - and the mysteries and apparent contradictions of quantum physics, and explores what that means for our lives here on Earth - and beyond.

 At its core, The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far is about the best of what it means to be human - an epic history of our ultimately purposeless universe that addresses the question, “Why are we here?”

 Only from Audible comes this exclusive laugh-out-loud rom com, perfect for fans of Emily Henry and Beth O’Leary.

 Kitty Harris has it all: cosily coupled up with boyfriend Archie, she’s putting in the hours at an ad agency to land her dream job. OK, so maybe they’ve become a bit too cosy in their routine, with pizza night every Thursday, and maybe the agency isn’t so much up-and-coming as been-and-gone, but Kitty is happy.

 Until one diamond ring sitting pretty in her pepperoni ruins everything. Kitty does NOT want to get married, not after being caught in the crosshairs of her parent’s destructive divorce. Desperate not to lose Archie altogether, Kitty takes a summer-long break so she can turn her ‘I don’t’ into ‘I do’. Somehow.

 Enter Leo Evans, Kitty’s impeccably dressed advertising nemesis who loves to appear at the very worst moment. Needing a distraction of his own, Leo claims to have the cure for Kitty’s cold feet: a no-strings rebound fling and a ten-date plan to face her marriage fears. Kitty shouldn’t really be fraternizing with the gorgeous enemy, not when they’re about to go head-to-head for the biggest pitch of their careers, but if it means getting her happily-ever-after with Archie, it’s a risk she’s willing to take.

 This rebound is about to get complicated. Luckily, you can’t catch feelings when you’re still madly in love with someone else … right?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Leeanne Slade/The Rebound.jpg" alt="Cover of The Rebound" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Rebound</span></div>

A MOST ANTICIPATED SUMMER READ from People, USA TODAY, theSkimm, E! News, Forbes, New York Post, CrimeReads, and many more!

 From #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jewell, three women are connected by one man in this kaleidoscopic thriller.

 He’s the perfect man. It’s a perfect lie.

Nina Swann is intrigued when she received a condolence card from Nick Radcliffe, an old friend of her late husband, who is looking to connect after her husband’s unexpected death. Nick is a man of substance and good taste. He has a smile that could melt the coldest heart and a knack for putting others at ease. But to Nina’s adult daughter, Ash, Nick seems too slick, too polished, too good to be true. Without telling her mother, Ash begins digging into Nick’s past. What she finds is more than unsettling…

Martha is a florist living in a neighboring town with her infant daughter and her devoted husband, Alistair. But lately, Alistair has been traveling more and more frequently for work, disappearing for days at a time. When Martha questions him about his frequent absences, he always has a legitimate explanation, but Martha can’t share the feeling that something isn’t right.

Nina, Martha, and Ash are on a collision course with a shocking truth that is far darker than anyone could have imagined. And all three are about to wish they had heeded the same warning: Don’t let him in. But the past won’t stay buried forever."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Lisa Jewell/Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Don&#x27;t Let Him In - A Novel</span></div>

 &quot;An irresistibly addictive tour of the human condition.&quot; (Kirkus, starred review)

 &quot;Rarely have I read a book that challenged me to see myself in an entirely new light, and was at the same time laugh-out-loud funny and utterly absorbing.&quot; (Katie Couric)

 &quot;This is a daring, delightful, and transformative book.&quot; (Arianna Huffington, founder, Huffington Post and founder &amp; CEO, Thrive Global)

 &quot;Wise, warm, smart, and funny. You must read this book.&quot; (Susan Cain, New York Times best-selling author of Quiet)

 From a New York Times best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist&#x27;s world - where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).

 One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose of­fice she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.

 As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients&#x27; lives - a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a 20-something who can&#x27;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys - she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.

 With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.

 Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Lori Gottlieb/Maybe You Should Talk to Someone.jpg" alt="Cover of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone - A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone - A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed</span></div>

 Casting the Runes - adapted by Stephen Gallagher

 When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - The Truth of Alchemy, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.

 On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: &#x27;In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.&#x27; Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse?

 Lost Hearts - adapted by A. K. Benedict

 Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.

 The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas - adapted by Jonathan Barnes

 When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.

 A View from a Hill - adapted by Mark Morris

 Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, &#x27;Mummy.&#x27; Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/M. R. James/The Conception of Terror- Tales Inspired by M. R.

 Heroin.

 With one taste, the love that once flowed through Nicole&#x27;s veins turns into cravings. Tracks mark the passing of time, and heroin&#x27;s grip gets tighter. It holds her hand through deaths and prostitution, but her addiction keeps her in the darkness. When her family tries to strike a match to help light her way, Nicole must choose between a life she can hardly remember, and a love for heroin she&#x27;ll never forget."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Marni Mann/Memoirs Aren&#x27;t Fairytales - A Story of Addiction.jpg" alt="Cover of Memoirs Aren&#x27;t Fairytales - A Story of Addiction" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Memoirs Aren&#x27;t Fairytales - A Story of Addiction</span></div>

For fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie&#x27;s Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks&#x27; Culture novels.

 All Systems Red tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans.

 In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.

 But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn&#x27;t a primary concern.

 On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied &#x27;droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as &quot;Murderbot.&quot;

 Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it&#x27;s up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Martha Wells/All Systems Red.jpg" alt="Cover of All Systems Red" loading="lazy" /></button><span>All Systems Red</span></div>

 Born to a prominent Chicago judge and his stifled socialite wife, Mia Dennett moves against the grain as a young inner-city art teacher. One night, Mia enters a bar to meet her on-again, off-again boyfriend. But when he doesn&#x27;t show, she unwisely leaves with an enigmatic stranger. With his smooth moves and modest wit, Colin Thatcher seems at first like a safe one-night stand. But following Colin home will turn out to be the worst mistake of Mia&#x27;s life.

 Colin&#x27;s job was to abduct Mia as part of a wild extortion plot and deliver her to his employers. But the plan takes an unexpected turn when Colin suddenly decides to hide Mia in a secluded cabin in rural Minnesota, evading the police and his deadly superiors. Mia&#x27;s mother, Eve, and Detective Gabe Hoffman will stop at nothing to find them, but no one could have predicted the emotional entanglements that eventually cause this family&#x27;s world to shatter.

 A man. His ex-girlfriend&#x27;s cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.

 In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth - from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds - collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.

 The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.

 Only a few dare venture inside. But once you&#x27;re in, you can&#x27;t get out. And what&#x27;s worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it&#x27;s game over. In this game, it&#x27;s not about your strength or your dexterity. It&#x27;s about your followers, your views. Your clout. It&#x27;s about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.

 You can&#x27;t just survive here. You gotta survive big.

 You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that &quot;it&quot; factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That&#x27;s the only way to truly survive in this game - with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.

An old grudge between a talk show host, an heiress, and the man they shattered along the way. A rapidly deteriorating AI system. An inconvenient tiara upon the head of a friend.

 It is bedlam on the eighth floor.

 As management reels from the unexpected conclusion of the seventh level, the surviving crawlers stumble onto the eighth and find themselves scattered. It’s a map based on Earth’s final days before the collapse, where ethereal, intangible ghosts of humanity go about their lives, oblivious of the impending doom. Living amongst these ghosts are monsters based in Earth lore. “Legendary” creatures tied to the geographical location they inhabit.

 Each team of crawlers is given a task: find and capture six of these beasts. The captured monsters will be turned into cards. Cards that can be summoned into battle again and again. The stronger and deadlier the better.

 At the end of the floor, the bad guys will also have decks, and they will have some of the most powerful cards available. So it’s crucial to assemble the toughest squad possible.

 But like always, there is a catch. There’s always a catch.

 As Carl and Donut know all too well, just because someone is captured, it doesn’t mean they have been tamed.

 Her name is Shi Maria. She’s easily the most powerful monster in their area. If they want to survive, they must capture her. But she is no ordinary beast. She’s intelligent. She was once married to a god, a god who is now missing. Her special attack is known to drive one insane. They call her the Bedlam Bride.

Book seven in the best-selling Dungeon Crawler Carl series is here!

 They call it Faction Wars.

 The ninth floor.

 Nine armies, each led by rich and powerful aliens from across the galaxy. Each team has one objective: to capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, and, of course, betrayal ... It all makes for great fun and even greater television.

 After all, none of these powerful aliens really die when they’re playing war.

 Except this time. This time, winner takes all. Those who fall, stay in the ground.

 As the AI continues its rapid decline, Carl and company take advantage of the chaos. For the first time ever, the crawlers are fighting back. They are now one of the nine teams. And this season, there’s a tenth army on the playing field. The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and formed a team of their own.

 For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. Only one of them will be allowed to leave this level.

 If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two.

 This is it.

 This is what they’ve been fighting toward.

 This is war.

 Austin wondered, is there anything else?

 He made it to the top. As CEO of an asteroid mining company, Austin has accomplished everything he ever wanted in business. Now, he needs more. To get away he turns to a fantasy video game.

 Is virtual reality the answer?

 Should he pick, elf, gnome, caster, or swordsman?

 He just wants peace and quiet, play as a dwarf, build a house, do some smithing and character building. His idea of the perfect fantasy game. Then he learns their secret.

 Deceit hides in the shadows.

 And the truth is all around.

 Austin will need to level up.

 If he gets caught, it means death. He’ll need help along the way. How can he convince anyone they’re slaves in a bigger game and stay under the radar? If Earth was a simulation and the game was real...

 Who can he trust?

 You’ll get hooked on this first book (of 11) in the Emerilia LitRPG series, because the characters grow and advance in the most believable of ways and the plot twists are fantastic. Any sufficiently advanced virtual reality makes it indistinguishable from reality.

 Victor Shelby ends each day wondering when his life is going to get better. His parents are dead, he struggles to pay rent, and his boss at the animal control shelter has him cleaning cages instead of working in the field. His dream of helping animals seems destined to end in a mop bucket.

 Then, Victor is abducted by aliens and deposited on a prehistoric world filled with hungry dinosaurs and beautiful alien women.

 He doesn’t know why he is here or what his purpose is, but he finds himself fighting for survival. Most men would have been lizard kibble in a few moments, but Victor’s natural ability to empathize with animals has grown stronger, and he finds himself able to control the most docile of the terrible lizards.

 Victor will have to use his taming powers to provide food, water, and shelter for the three women that he has sworn to protect. Success means they get to live another day; failure means a horrible death in the jaws of Earth’s most deadly predators.

But after a very public fight with her husband, she realizes things may not be as perfect as they seem: Her husband is lying to her, the money is disappearing, and there’s a stranger on the beach outside her house.

 As Caroline’s marriage and her carefully constructed lifestyle begin to collapse around her, she turns to Aidan, the stranger, for comfort...and revenge. After a brief and desperate fling that means nothing to Caroline and everything to him, Aiden’s infatuation with Caroline, her family, and her house becomes more and more destructive.

Now hear her story.

 Audible has teamed up with Rolling Stone to produce an uncompromisingly honest Audible Original that honors the life and legacy of the incomparable Aretha Franklin. Aretha’s universal appeal was evident from the release of her first album at age 14 through her nearly 50 Top 40 hits. Yet this intimate biography reminds us that Aretha knew pain as much as she knew glory. It was the blues, residing deep within her soul, that gave way to a voice able to lift millions with a profound sense of freedom, self-worth, and undeniable talent to rise above sorrow.

 Aretha’s unshakeable foundation of faith - fueled by a childhood spent singing in church alongside her famous father, minister C.L. Franklin - allowed her to blend heartbreak with spirituality in soul-stirring song. By diving into the true story of Aretha - from the years following her mother’s passing to the moment she decided to become a singer - the listener can’t help but glimpse the roots of the sorrow behind her famous eyes."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Mikal Gilmore/The Queen - Aretha Franklin.jpg" alt="Cover of The Queen - Aretha Franklin" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Queen - Aretha Franklin</span></div>

 The Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. Beginning as a small city-state in central Italy, Rome gradually expanded into a wider world filled with petty tyrants, barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. Through the centuries, Rome&#x27;s model of cooperative and participatory government remained remarkably durable and unmatched in the history of the ancient world.

 In 146 BC, Rome finally emerged as the strongest power in the Mediterranean. But the very success of the Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome now ruled: rising economic inequality disrupted traditional ways of life, endemic social and ethnic prejudice led to clashes over citizenship and voting rights, and rampant corruption and ruthless ambition sparked violent political clashes that cracked the once indestructible foundations of the Republic.

 Chronicling the years 146-78 BC, The Storm Before the Storm dives headlong into the first generation to face this treacherous new political environment. Abandoning the ancient principles of their forbearers, men like Marius, Sulla, and the Gracchi brothers set dangerous new precedents that would start the Republic on the road to destruction and provide a stark warning about what can happen to a civilization that has lost its way."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Mike Duncan/The Storm Before the Storm.jpg" alt="Cover of The Storm Before the Storm - The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Storm Before the Storm - The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic</span></div>

 Hot on the heels of The Twin, the undisputed queen of YA thrillers is back with a scary and suspenseful read about a summer camp filled with dark secrets.

 Esme and Kayla once were campers at Camp Pine Lake. Now they’re back as counselors-in-training. Esme loves the little girls in her cabin and thinks it’s funny how scared they are of everything - the woods, the bugs, the boys...even swimming in the lake. It reminds her of how she and Kayla used to be. Before...

 Because Esme and Kayla did something terrible when they were campers. Something they’ve kept a secret all these years. They vow that this summer will be awesome. Two months of sun, s’mores, and flirting with the cute boy counselors. But then they get a message:

 The lake never forgets.

 The secret they’ve kept buried for so many years is about to resurface.

 “[T]he strong buildup…leads to a shockingly satisfying finale. An eerie thriller reminiscent of summer horror movies that will keep readers on edge.” (Kirkus)

 From the viral TikTok author of the stalker romcom, LIGHTS OUT, comes Navessa Allen’s second book in best-selling The Into Darkness Trilogy, upping the ante with voyeurism and play club kink.

 “I wanted this woman, and I was a man who always got what he wanted.”

 Nico &quot;Junior&quot; Trocci knows Lauren Marchetti is off limits. She is sweetness and laughter, whereas Junior exists in a world of violence and depravity. Men like him don’t get to have women like her. It’s why he pushed her away back in high school and kept his distance ever since.

 But when Junior looks Lauren up online, he discovers the shy, bookish girl he remembers is gone. In her place is a strikingly beautiful woman whose social media is filled with scantily clad pictures of herself and a connection to a nearby play club. Junior’s innocent curiosity quickly turns into a dark obsession. Watching Lauren from a distance isn’t enough; he needs to make her his.

 “He’s ruthless; a walking red flag. Good thing red is my favorite color.”

 Lauren is intrigued by the mystery man who keeps showing up at her club, who tempts her white-hot desires. But as their flirty online messages stir up a deeper form of connection, Lauren worries she’s developing real feelings for this brooding stranger. As their combined desire ratchets up to a breaking point, who will seduce who?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Navessa Allen/Caught Up - Into Darkness, Book 2.jpg" alt="Cover of Caught Up - Into Darkness, Book 2" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Caught Up - Into Darkness, Book 2</span></div>

 Mortal or divine, the bloodshed must end, and Dust is the mage for the job. But first he must contend with a succubus, a talking sword, a spider queen, a goddess of magic, and eldritch abominations from beyond the stars. No big deal...right?

 What is the nature of space and time? How do we fit within the universe? How does the universe fit within us? There’s no better guide through these mind-expanding questions than acclaimed astrophysicist and bestselling author Neil deGrasse Tyson.

 But today, few of us have time to contemplate the cosmos. So Tyson brings the universe down to Earth succinctly and clearly, with sparkling wit, in digestible chapters consumable anytime and anywhere in your busy day.

 While waiting for your morning coffee to brew, or while waiting for the bus, the train, or the plane to arrive, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry will reveal just what you need to be fluent and ready for the next cosmic headlines: from the Big Bang to black holes, from quarks to quantum mechanics, and from the search for planets to the search for life in the universe."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Neil Degrasse Tyson/Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.jpg" alt="Cover of Astrophysics for People in a Hurry" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</span></div>

 &quot;Like a spaceship traveling the stars, Tyson&#x27;s voice flows smoothly as he delivers complex topics and positive perspectives on the future...&quot;- AudioFile

 This program is read by the author, world-renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

 Bringing his cosmic perspective to civilization on Earth, Neil deGrasse Tyson shines new light on the crucial fault lines of our time—war, politics, religion, truth, beauty, gender, and race—in a way that stimulates a deeper sense of unity for us all.

 In a time when our political and cultural views feel more polarized than ever, Tyson provides a much-needed antidote to so much of what divides us, while making a passionate case for the twin chariots of enlightenment—a cosmic perspective and the rationality of science.

 After thinking deeply about how science sees the world and about Earth as a planet, the human brain has the capacity to reset and recalibrates life’s priorities, shaping the actions we might take in response. No outlook on culture, society, or civilization remains untouched.

 With crystalline prose, Starry Messenger walks us through the scientific palette that sees and paints the world differently. From insights on resolving global conflict to reminders of how precious it is to be alive, Tyson reveals, with warmth and eloquence, an array of brilliant and beautiful truths that apply to us all, informed and enlightened by knowledge of our place in the universe.

An entire city goes up in smoke and ash, and an entire province is slowly being consumed by an ever-expanding cloud of death.

 But while the humans rally to contain the fallout of this disaster, they are much quicker to pin the blame for it on their elven neighbors to the north. With centuries&#x27; worth of strife and bad blood between the two nations flaring up, all out war is rapidly becoming an inevitability.

 Powerful figures are already on the move. Some wish to unravel the mystery behind the dead city in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. Others are more than content enough to use this &quot;act of terrorism&quot; as an excuse to further the Empire&#x27;s agenda. A select few are even planning on somehow turning this cataclysm into a weapon for the sake of their ambitions. The elves of the Ishigar Republic are hard at work undermining and sabotaging their old enemy, while the international community watches the ongoing situation with a critical eye. Even the Gods themselves are closely monitoring the situation, ready to intervene should they deem it necessary.

 However, though all these entities have different reasons and methods, they all have the same objective - to find the mastermind responsible for setting all this in motion.

 The same &quot;mastermind&quot; that is far too busy figuring out how wagons work to notice the world is stirring.

The former are seen as hardcore traditionalists hell-bent on maintaining the status quo, while the latter only look ever forward and upward as they grasp at the future with both hands. And yet, these two seemingly opposing cultures serve as a counter-balance to each other, creating a civilization that draws upon the wisdom of the past to face new challenges. Whether that is actually the case or mere propaganda will soon to be put to the test, as they are about to receive a visit from the Hero of Chaos. The enigmatic herald of change has already fostered a well-deserved reputation for setting things in motion by their presence, and only time will tell if the Kingdom of the stout-folk will survive the impending transition.

 Though, once again, Boxxy doesn&#x27;t actually care what ripples it causes. It isn&#x27;t there to upset society or challenge the stagnant culture of all-work-no-play. Its goal is to track down an errant treasure that escaped its grasp while it was out of commission, and maybe secure some new pieces for its ever-growing collection along the way. Before it has a chance to, however, it must first deal with a significant issue that threatens to undo much of its work since its arrival in Azurvale. It is a challenge unlike any it has faced, and not one that it can hope to solve easily through force and violence. The limits of Boxxy&#x27;s patience and self-control are about to be tested, as it looks desperately for a way...to leave the house.

Though this conflict seems inevitable and promises to be horrific, the common folk can do little but act like there&#x27;s nothing wrong. Rather than lose sleep over something so wildly out of their control, they instead worry about tiny, personal, inconsequential issues. Things like, &quot;Will the butcher have fresh steak today?&quot; and, &quot;Should I get those new boots now, or wait and see if they go on sale?&quot;

 However, though they try to maintain some modicum of normalcy, the people of Azurvale have yet to find out that their capital is already under threat. Not by some warmongering nation, but by a certain individual that has come to them seeking asylum, knowledge, profit, and power through any means necessary. As this newcomer burrows into the city&#x27;s underbelly like a voracious tick, it cares not for the people it hurts along the way. Indeed, any soul unfortunate enough to cross paths with Boxxy T. Morningwood seems doomed to have their life ruined in one way or another. Often through no fault of their own.

 Whether it&#x27;s an ancient being, a skilled assassin, a godlike archer, or a fresh-faced recruit, none shall be spared from the whims of chaos.

Armed with his grandfather&#x27;s trusty longsword and the dream of being the strongest, he sets out on the journey of a lifetime! It is sure to be a long and dangerous road, fraught with danger! And it all starts with a simple test - reach Level Five in the dungeon called the &quot;newbie zone&quot; and earn the right to become a full-fledged adventurer!

 However, such things get hopelessly derailed when his adolescent mind beholds an exposed chest for the first time - a fateful meeting that would inevitably lead his life in a direction he never even dreamed of!

That is how history will remember the date when two Overlords clashed amidst the war-torn streets of New Whitehall. The disastrous duel its explosive conclusion wreaked heavy casualties on the two armies present, rendering both the Ishigar Republic and the Lodrak Empire unable to continue to fight. And yet, it was no stalemate. With one Hero defeated and another revealed, the balance of power is sure to shift in the elvish nation’s favor. The Republic’s leaders will surely not hesitate to seize this opportunity, as they had already paid for it in blood and gold. Meanwhile the Lodrak Empire is gripped by unease overnight as their Goddess mysteriously falls silent.

 Boxxy doesn’t care about any of that at the moment. Mostly because the confrontation with Teresa has left it in a comatose state at a most inopportune time. With the Hero status of its public persona revealed, it will be forced to rapidly adapt and escalate its plans. Whereas before it only had to worry about keeping its true identity a secret, it will now have to worry about its alter ego being targeted. Each chosen of the divines is a controversial figure, and the suddenly revealed Hero of Chaos will surely attract a lot of attention.

 And, as the shapeshifter’s primal instincts are well aware, too much attention can and will lead to a surprise meeting with Death itself.

Following the unprecedented outcome of the siege at Fort Yimin, both the Republic and the Empire are forced to drastically reevaluate their plans for the conflict. With matters on the western front more or less settled for the moment, the warring nations turn their attention toward the eastern theatre. Winter looms on the horizon, threatening to deadlock the region and put a temporary halt to hostilities. With both sides planning to deploy bold and unconventional strategies on top of committing vast resources, it’s anyone’s guess which of them will come out on top.

 Indeed, neither government is shying away from resorting to underhanded, questionable, or downright amoral means. The Gilded Hand has been stepping up their efforts to further Spymaster Edward Allen’s schemes. The Empire’s intelligence agency is also looking to field its most powerful enforcers in the coming battles. The Republic’s Foreign Intelligence Bureau is having a hard time keeping up, but they are not without their own dirty tricks. Rumors within the royal palace of the Horkensaft Kingdom to the east suggest that the dwarves and gnomes are on the verge of aiding the elven nation. Something that wouldn’t have been made possible without the Republic’s deep coffers, and the less-than-reputable individuals that fill them.

 Boxxy T. Morningwood isn’t one of those shady contributors. If anything, it’s been steadily draining the government’s resources as it forces them to pay exorbitant fees to resolve issues that the monster itself creates. A trend it plans to keep following for as long as it can lie, cheat, and murder its way through life.

 Which, barring something ridiculous like divine intervention, is poised to be a very long time indeed.

 Things are far less jovial for the one under Tom&#x27;s &quot;care&quot;, however. Stuck in the monster-infested wilderness, lacking the usual backup, hunted by the Empire&#x27;s top brass, and tasked with an incredibly vague and obtuse Quest, Boxxy will face a world of uncertainty and adversity. However, this is nothing new. Pain, suffering, and loss are things that have been commonplace since day one, and Boxxy is not only entirely undaunted, but also eager to share those valuable lessons with its new &quot;companion&quot;. With things both shiny and tasty on the line, the crafty killer has every intention of showing that lich who&#x27;s boss.

 Assuming Boxxy manages to find it, of course.

 Wally Roux is a teenage genius with a big imagination and a big heart, who just moved to Savannah, GA, from Maine with his mom, who adopted him when he was an infant. In this charming and sweet solo performance, Wally investigates what is causing a number of strange events and occurrences. He explores and gets lost within space-time - an infinite, indefinable, and mysterious void that you can’t see but when you slice into it you can feel it.

 Part science fiction and part coming-of-age story, Wally Roux follows one boy’s journey of self-discovery and self-identity.

 Felix&#x27;s life on Earth had become a series of dead-end jobs, ruined relationships, and rotating apartments smaller than most postage stamps. By all accounts, even his own, he was a coward. Too afraid to move forward, to take risks. Yet when given the chance to choose between risking his life or walking away from a deadly encounter, he didn&#x27;t hesitate.

 Moments before his untimely demise, Felix was snatched from earth and thrust into a magical world known only as &quot;The Continent&quot;. Empowered by the &quot;System&quot;, he learns that he can strengthen himself through combat and dedication. To survive, he&#x27;ll have to push himself beyond his limits, or else fall to the monsters all around him.

 Seth Kinnaman&#x27;s dream has always been to become the best fighter the world has ever seen. After spending his entire life training, he&#x27;s finally ready to test his skills in the biggest tournament on Earth, where hundreds of the fiercest competitors vie for the supreme title.

 In the semifinals, Seth is getting the upper hand when his opponent uses an illegal blow to take him out. Upon waking up from a coma, Seth finds out he&#x27;s lost his sight. He&#x27;s become blind, and he&#x27;s completely devastated. All his dreams are now shattered, and he soon falls into depression. What is he going to do with his life?

 That&#x27;s when he&#x27;s introduced to Bushido Online, a game that promises to keep his skills sharp while he figures out what his next move is going to be. Set in feudal Japan, this VRMMORPG is the land of ninjas and samurai. A world where the most honorable warriors meet the vilest bandits and where mythical creatures roam free. When he&#x27;ll enter that new reality, Seth will discover that while it&#x27;s easy to make friends there, one doesn&#x27;t have to try very hard to get his fair share of powerful enemies.

 Soon he&#x27;s going to have entire clans hunting him down as he struggles to learn the ropes and regain a sense of normalcy. Thankfully, Seth has a few things going for him: his extensive knowledge of combat and a never-say-die attitude.

 Bushido Online: The Battle Begins is the first book in the Bushido Online series, a work of litRPG fiction.

 A stunning novel from the #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts - Year One is an epic of hope and horror, chaos and magick, and a journey that will unite a desperate group of people to fight the battle of their lives...

 It began on New Year’s Eve.

 The sickness came on suddenly, and spread quickly. The fear spread even faster. Within weeks, everything people counted on began to fail them. The electrical grid sputtered; law and government collapsed - and more than half of the world’s population was decimated.

 Where there had been order, there was now chaos. And as the power of science and technology receded, magick rose up in its place. Some of it is good, like the witchcraft worked by Lana Bingham, practicing in the loft apartment she shares with her lover, Max. Some of it is unimaginably evil, and it can lurk anywhere, around a corner, in fetid tunnels beneath the river - or in the ones you know and love the most.

 As word spreads that neither the immune nor the gifted are safe from the authorities who patrol the ravaged streets, and with nothing left to count on but each other, Lana and Max make their way out of a wrecked New York City. At the same time, other travelers are heading west too, into a new frontier. Chuck, a tech genius trying to hack his way through a world gone offline. Arlys, a journalist who has lost her audience but uses pen and paper to record the truth. Fred, her young colleague, possessed of burgeoning abilities and an optimism that seems out of place in this bleak landscape. And Rachel and Jonah, a resourceful doctor and a paramedic who fend off despair with their determination to keep a young mother and three infants in their care alive.

 In a world of survivors where every stranger encountered could be either a savage or a savior, none of them knows exactly where they are heading, or why. But a purpose awaits them that will shape their lives and the lives of all those who remain.

 The end has come. The beginning comes next."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Nora Roberts/Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Year One - Chronicles of The One, Book 1</span></div>

 Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. Jess and Jason, she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.

 Marie Sklodowska, 25, is studying science at the Sorbonne—one of the only universities in the world that has begun to admit women. A thousand miles from her native Poland, with no money and the odds stacked against any woman daring to pursue a career in such a rigorous field, Marie throws herself into her studies. She’s certain that to succeed in a man’s world, she will have to go it alone.

 Her meticulous plans get thrown slightly off-course when Marie attracts the attention of an accomplished physicist, himself on the precipice of greatness. Pierre Curie, famous for his work on symmetry, believes he has found in Marie an equal who shares his devotion to scientific discovery. He offers to help with her work, and soon begins to court her. But to Marie, men have always been an obstacle, love a distraction from her goals. She hasn’t come this far to let either stand in the way of her dreams—dreams Pierre insists they can share.

 In A Mind of Her Own, McLain taps into the luminous mind and complex heart of a singular woman caught between order and chaos, science and love in the period just before the world would learn her name."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Paula Mclain/A Mind of Her Own.jpg" alt="Cover of A Mind of Her Own" loading="lazy" /></button><span>A Mind of Her Own</span></div>

Keeping it could cost Diem her life.

 The threat of war has arrived at Diem&#x27;s doorstep, along with a new discovery that could save her people. To use it, she must survive the next thirty days by forming a devil&#x27;s bargain with the people she hates most: the royal family of House Corbois.

 As she dives into the world of the Descended elite, Diem quickly realizes good and evil aren&#x27;t as simple as they seem. Old prejudices are challenged, and new loyalties blur the line between friend and foe.

 Meanwhile, her mother is still missing, and the secrets she left behind can no longer be ignored—and neither can the Guardians and their demands. Caught between an old flame and a sizzling new spark, Diem must confront the truth about who she is and what she wants before time runs out.

 War is coming, and dangerous enemies wait on all sides... but the most deadly battle Diem faces may be the one for her heart.

 From the hugely talented author of The Kind Worth Killing comes an exquisitely chilling tale of a young suburban wife with a history of psychological instability whose fears about her new neighbor could lead them both to murder....

 Hen and her husband, Lloyd, have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she’s found some stability and peace.

 But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband’s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she’s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder - an obsession she doesn’t talk about anymore but can’t fully shake, either.

 Could her neighbor Matthew be a killer? Or is this the beginning of another psychotic episode like the one she suffered back in college, when she became so consumed with proving a fellow student guilty that she ended up hurting a classmate?

 The more Hen observes Matthew, the more she suspects he’s planning something truly terrifying. Yet no one will believe her. Then one night, when she comes face-to-face with Matthew in a dark parking lot, she realizes he knows she’s been watching him, that she’s really on to him; and that this is the beginning of a horrifying nightmare she may not live to escape...."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Peter Swanson/Before She Knew Him - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Before She Knew Him - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Before She Knew Him - A Novel</span></div>

 It&#x27;s a bad day when Erin finds herself transported to a fantastical world and nearly gets eaten by a Dragon. She doesn&#x27;t belong in a place where monster attacks are a fact of life, and where Humans are one species among many. But she must adapt to her new life. Or die.

 Camp nights or camp frights?

 Every sleepaway camp promises memories that last a lifetime. But the memories from Camp Red Moon might give you nightmares!

  The campfire appears to dim when the moon turns blood red and strange creatures prowl the forest.  Do you find a total lookalike at camp? Is it coincidence or is he a shapeshifter trying to take over your life?  Why don&#x27;t your competitors at the robotics competition seem exactly...human?  And why do campers do anything to avoid Cabin 6?   The master of the scary story, R.L.

 Elspeth needs a monster. The monster might be her.

 Elspeth Spindle needs more than luck to stay safe in the eerie, mist-locked kingdom of Blunder—she needs a monster. She calls him the Nightmare, an ancient, mercurial spirit trapped in her head. He protects her. He keeps her secrets.

 But nothing comes for free, especially magic.

 When Elspeth meets a mysterious highwayman on the forest road, her life takes a drastic turn. Thrust into a world of shadow and deception, she joins a dangerous quest to cure Blunder from the dark magic infecting it. Except the highwayman just so happens to be the King’s own nephew, Captain of the most dangerous men in Blunder…and guilty of high treason.

 He and Elspeth have until Solstice to gather twelve Providence Cards—the keys to the cure. But as the stakes heighten and their undeniable attraction intensifies, Elspeth is forced to face her darkest secret yet: the Nightmare is slowly, darkly, taking over her mind. And she might not be able to stop him."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rachel Gillig/One Dark Window.jpg" alt="Cover of One Dark Window" loading="lazy" /></button><span>One Dark Window</span></div>

Perfect for fans of Jennifer L. Armentrout and Leigh Bardugo.

 Sybil Delling has spent nine years dreaming of having no dreams at all. Like the other foundling girls who traded a decade of service for a home in the great cathedral, Sybil is a Diviner. In her dreams she receives visions from six unearthly figures known as Omens. From them, she can predict terrible things before they occur, and lords and common folk alike travel across the kingdom of Traum’s windswept moors to learn their futures by her dreams.

 Just as she and her sister Diviners near the end of their service, a mysterious knight arrives at the cathedral. Rude, heretical, and devilishly handsome, the knight Rodrick has no respect for Sybil&#x27;s visions. But when Sybil&#x27;s fellow Diviners begin to vanish one by one, she has no choice but to seek his help in finding them. For the world outside the cathedral’s cloister is wrought with peril. Only the gods have the answers she is seeking, and as much as she&#x27;d rather avoid Rodrick&#x27;s dark eyes and sharp tongue, only a heretic can defeat a god."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rachel Gillig/The Knight and the Moth.jpg" alt="Cover of The Knight and the Moth" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Knight and the Moth</span></div>

 Gripped by a tyrant king and in the thrall of dark magic, the kingdom is in peril.

If they’re going to find the card before Solstice and set free the kingdom, they will need to journey through the dangerous mist-cloaked forest. The only one who can lead them through is the monster that shares Elspeth’s head: the Nightmare.

 And he’s not eager to share any longer.

 Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don’t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie.

 If you have ever said any of these things to yourself...something else will make me happy; I’m not a good mom; I will never get past this; I am defined by my weight; I should be further along by now...then you could benefit from the unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity Rachel Hollis has in store for you. In this challenging but conversational audiobook, Rachel exposes the 20 lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we’ve told ourselves so often we don’t even hear them anymore.

 Rachel is real and talks about real issues. More than that, she reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.

 Alex finds herself on the shore of a distant place - a world unfamiliar.
 A world of fantasy and magic. A world that is a game.

 NPCs and players all insist she is an NPC, a part of the world. A part of the code of the game. A part of the fantasy to entertain the players. She rejects the idea, for her memories can&#x27;t just be lies. Could they?

 Alex sets out to establish herself in the sandbox fantasy world, to find her identity, and to weather the storm between the coming players and the inhabitants of the new world.

  Stand-alone story - no unending series  Female MC  Less numbers  Base building  Magic realism  Topics that might make Asimov chuckle  No harems  Swearing  Light sexual content   The World:
 The Multiverse Virtual Reality, known as the MWR or MVVR, is a collection of atomic-level simulations that exist as games and research experiments. Instance_ID8092, otherwise known as the Otherworld, is a mysterious new Virtual Reality MMO that was recently revealed in the long list of VRMMOs. As soon as the players found the new game, they dove in to find an entire world thriving with NPCs.

 The world exists as a geographic copy of pre-war Earth with its inhabitants enjoying a pre-industrial level of technology. Beyond the proliferation of magic, the NPCs use player-given technology daily - airships, muskets, and manatech engines."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rae Nantes/Polyglot - NPC ReEvolution.jpg" alt="Cover of Polyglot - NPC ReEvolution" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Polyglot - NPC ReEvolution</span></div>

He&#x27;s enriched himself, empowered his county with that coin, and built his county ever higher.

 The war swings in favor of his Duchess.

 Yet the war still goes on. The end doesn&#x27;t seem to be near, nor does Alex feel as if it is as simple as he&#x27;d once thought it. Alex would rather settle down in his county and live a quiet and enjoyable life. One filled with familial things and friends. Where he could make his county the pride of the empire in peace.

 Because he&#x27;d already gotten to the top once before. He&#x27;d climbed the corporate ladder in his previous life and missed out on really having one.

 Having friends. Or just a family.

 Now Alex wants only for the simple things. Things that have no place on the battlefield, kingdom politics, or the courts.

 That, of course, doesn&#x27;t matter much when fate is concerned. Or really, everyone else in the empire. They all have their own plans that all seem to run counter to Alex&#x27;s.

 Fortunately, Alex has been preparing. Making changes and building his foundation and seat of power ever higher.

 He&#x27;s empowered the people he relies on and in. His armies are expertly trained and almost overequipped. His treasury is overflowing and ready to be spent.

 Even with all of that, Alex isn&#x27;t sure it&#x27;ll be enough for what he believes is coming.

 Because spring is here. And that means roads will be opening. Passes will be traversable.

 Making it possible for armies to march.

 Which means it&#x27;s time for Alex to get back to work. Because more than ever, he has a lot to lose, including his newborn children. If he wants to keep them safe, he&#x27;s going to have to ride to war once again.

 And end it once and for all, no matter the cost."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Randi Darren/Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Fostering Faust 3 - Fostering Faust, Book 3</span></div>

 Alex is dead.

 Dead and apparently with a one-way ticket to a place that only the worst of the worst go.

 All for a simple choice he made about a product his company owned.

 Damned for all time.

 Luckily for him, he’s about to be given a chance.

 Another choice to make.

 He can instead return to the land of the living, though his soul would belong to another. Except the world he’s being sent to isn’t the same one he came from. It’s not even a similar period in time, but from something long past in history.

 The dark ages.

 And part of the deal to live again, is to make pacts with others. Pacts that would bind the soul of those who take a deal to the same entity who owns Alex’s soul.

 How much would you give of yourself to live on is an easy question.

 The better question, is how much would you take from others?

 If Alex wants to keep living, to keep his soul from being sent to the darkest corner of hell, he’ll have to ask himself that question.

 Daily.

 Warning: This novel explores dark subjects, and what people will give up of themselves, and each other, to get what they want. The main character is written as a real person in a tough situation, and will not make choices that line up with societal and cultural norms.

 It contains adult themes and moral ambiguities.

 Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.

 He had been a door-to-door salesman of sorts. One who peddled wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.

 Except that life is gone now.

 His old business model had been modernized. Email, phone contacts, letters, flyers, business cards, and scheduled consultations.

 Sam was a man trapped in place by his own success. And loving it.

 Additionally, he was also the owner of a private military company that specialized in dealing with criminals or those wanted by a government.

 His goals were simple. Rebuilding his strength, establishing a comfortable life for himself and others, and taking from Jenaphila as much as he could.

 As he works to complete those objectives though, Sam’s going to run up against some of the biggest players in any of the planes. And make enemies out of more than a few.

 Everything is changing faster than Sam would like it to. Heading right toward what might just be the end of the prime plane itself.

 His old business model had been modernized. Email, phone contacts, letters, flyers, business cards, and scheduled consultations.

 Sam was a man trapped in place by his own success.

 And loving it.

 Additionally, he was also the owner of a private military company that specialized in dealing with criminals or those wanted by a government.

 His goals were simple. Rebuilding his strength, establishing a comfortable life for himself and others, and taking from Jenaphila as much as he could.

 Now, though, he’s gotten exactly what he wanted in the worst possible way.

 Jenaphila front and center with as much of her empire as he can grab. While she goes after him directly and with vengeance.

 Everything is changing faster than Sam would like it to.

 Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.

 He’s a door-to-door salesman, of sorts. One that peddles wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.

 Prices that usually involve a few years of your life, maybe a handful of days, or a single night of pleasure that’ll cost a few hours.

 He’s an incubus that solves problems. Mental, emotional, spiritual, material, and anything and everything in between. Sam can provide an answer and resolution.

 A one-man shop and service provider.

 Or he was. When he had work available to him.

 Unfortunately, he’s been unable to work for quite a while, due to the simple fact that he’s been imprisoned against his will by an old business partner.

 Except something’s changed.

 A portal, a way back to the planes, has opened with his name on it. On the other side isn’t what he wished for nor what he feared.

 Sam’s made the choice to go back and start up his business again. From the ground up. In just a moment he’ll make that leap over and into another plane.

 Little does he know that with that first step he’ll move straight from the known, to the unknown, then to the inadvisable.

 Warning: This novel explores dark subjects, and what people will give up of themselves, and each other, to get what they want. The main character is written as a demon from another plane in a tough situation, and will not make choices that line up with societal and cultural norms.

 It contains adult themes and moral ambiguities.

 As with my previous work, explicit scenes are found within. It has violence and a harem relationship."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Randi Darren/Incubus Inc.jpg" alt="Cover of Incubus Inc." loading="lazy" /></button><span>Incubus Inc.</span></div>

He does know a lot more than he did previously, though. He’s in a country called Lamals where men are required to have children, then more often than not, go fight and die. And that’s just how it is.

 Things are at least improving, though. Steve successfully put a stop to the Creep’s advance. He’d buried it under a mountain of broken wall and escaped with his life. Which eliminates one enemy. The creep and its undead.

 Now, he only has to worry about bandits, the military, the country of Lamals, and other people.

 With that problem nearly solved, Steve can worry about problems closer to home. After all, his only true concerns are about his farm and his family. That’s all he really needs. Everyone else are little better than a resource to be utilized.

 Unfortunately, things still aren’t what they seem to be. The messages Steve left himself pointed at something beyond their contents. Now, that &quot;something more&quot; is about to make contact with him. On top of that, the farm is going to hit capacity eventually. Especially if one factored into it that Steve was likely going to have children at some point in the future.

 Family troubles and more problems than he could expect are about to find Steve. Shooting up as if they were trees grown with his over-powered watering can.

 Good thing Steve has his axe. Any problem can be solved with it...with the right application of force.

 He knows more than enough to realize it doesn’t matter at all.

 Now living in what had once been the Creeplands and maintaining a thriving farm there, they are under constant siege from the Creep itself.

 It&#x27;s still better than life in Lamals.

 And that’s just how it is.

 After taking over the Citadel, removing Lynn from her place of power, stopping the Creep’s advance, and starting to take over part of the Creeplands, he was certainly making a difference for himself, humans, and men everywhere.

 But with the problems that were close to home eliminated, he now needs to start working on external threats to his personal world. His Citadel and his two farms.

 Before he had only concerned himself with what was near and dear to him, but he&#x27;d overlooked that others saw him as a resource to be utilized.

 Or eliminated.

 On top of all of that, it’s becoming clear that he’s rapidly reaching the end of his task. A task he doesn’t truly know or understand, but one that he apparently agreed to when he still had all his memories. A task assigned to him by a merciless voice that clearly thinks little of him.

 Family troubles are starting to look like a sweet memory and dream compared to what’s on the horizon for him.

 His path could very well lead to the complete collapse of Lamals. At least, if he has anything to say about it.

 This time around, however, even his axe may not be up to the job and he’ll have to resort to more drastic measures.

 After all, any problem can be solved with the right application of force.

 Even a road to hell paved with good intentions.

 All Steve knows is that he’s apparently supposed to build a farm. At least that’s his only workable assumption. Given the number of farm-tools left to him. That and the massive number of sacks full of seeds.

 Unfortunately, this isn’t even the strangest part of this new life.

 Hidden inside the farm tools, Steve finds messages. Messages that appear in floating windows in front of him.

 Messages from his past self, telling him that he’d already failed once.

 But he has no idea what he actually failed at. Or how he can succeed this time.

 Beyond all this, and unfortunately for Steve, the world just underwent a radical change. A change that’s going to have Steve fighting the undead, bandits, nature, and even himself. All while the world falls down around him.

 And the only weapon he has is an axe.

 Someone born to maintain, fix, and correct any and every issue that could go wrong in the habitat he lives in. Someone who makes sure he and his fellow humans can remain on display and entertain their owners as any good human pet would.

 He’s taken a different route and joined a resistance faction to help free humanity to become more than just pets to an alien race.

 Now at the end of his life, and realizing what a waste all his effort has been, Wrench finds himself given a chance to go back to his youth and relive his life.

 He’s going to be granted a superpower: the ability to alter anything and everything regarding his own body, from forcing his body to heal faster to speeding up his perception of time so that everything runs in slow motion.

 That power comes with a price tag, of course: a favor in the distant future for the man giving him his do-over.

 Accepting the deal, since being alive is far more beneficial than being dead, Wrench is thrown back into the past to live his life all over again, in whatever way he sees fit—whether it be rejoining the resistance, living as a Fixer and taking a leadership role, or just finding a wife and having kids.

 Or utilizing his newfound superpower to alter anything and everything about his body’s systems to become something completely different.

 Regardless of whatever choice he makes, though, he’s got a lot of things to fix. Good thing he’s well suited to fixing problems.

 Before World War II could reach its conclusion, the world suffered what could only be defined as a cataclysm.

 Now, Yosemite City stands as the gateway between two worlds. The empire of humanity to the west, and the wild wastes to the east.

 Standing at the helm for Yosemite is Vince, a ranger turned city-state ruler. Supporting him in his endeavors is his inner circle.

 Vince has begun to maneuver through the intricacies of ruling. At the same time he must balance his expanding foundation and fend off external threats.

 Thankfully, every single citizen of Yosemite is united to the cause. To make their home, permanent. To dig out their place in the world and make a stand.

 Things are starting to spiral out of control. Almost as quickly as he can put it all back together something else falls apart.

 And with Yosemite rapidly rising into prominence, Vince finds that it really means just putting a bull&#x27;s-eye on your back.

Now, Yosemite city stands as the gateway between two worlds and an equal power in the continent. Unfortunately, it’s surrounded on all sides by those who would love to see them fail: the empire in the west, a king to the east, and the tri-lliance of the wastes to the south.

 Standing at the top of Yosemite is the warrior king Vince, a ranger turned city state ruler. Supporting him in his endeavors is his inner circle. With a firm grasp on Yosemite, Vince has solidified his borders. He’s gotten the army trained to an elite status. He’s given his people a peaceful lifestyle with an economy that grows year over year. Yosemite is well and truly prospering.

 There is a delicate balance between nations in military and trade, however. One that is going to be upended with a skirmish in the lands of southern Yosemite.

 The bullseye Vince had worked so hard to remove is back, and bigger than ever. All anyone can do now is prepare for the storm.

 Legend has it that an experiment failed. Catastrophically so. And when it failed, the center of the United States, from the Sierra Nevada to the Mississippi river, became &quot;The Waste&quot;, where everything changed.

 In The Waste, every fantasy creature, fairytale demon, or mythological monster exists. From orcs, to neriads, ogres, trolls, wraiths, elves, harpies, and even beastmen. They all exist, and all despise humankind.

 In the ruins of the west and east coasts, new governments have arisen. With new jobs.

 Vince is a Ranger, a profession whose sole job duty is surviving in the waste, and taking missions from the Ranger Guild. Be it courier services, escorts, or simply exploring tombs and cities.

 Taking up an escort mission, Vince encounters a situation that will shape his life forever onward.

And the ones with power rule.

 Gold. Gold floors, gold walls, gold furniture, gold clothes. In Highbell, in the castle built into the frozen mountains, everything is made of gold. Even me.

 King Midas rescued me. Dug me out of the slums and placed me on a pedestal. I&#x27;m called his precious. His favored. I&#x27;m the woman he Gold-Touched to show everyone that I belong to him. To show how powerful he is. He gave me protection, and I gave him my heart. And even though I don&#x27;t leave the confines of the palace, I&#x27;m safe.

 Until war comes to the kingdom and a deal is struck.

 Suddenly, my trust is broken. My love is challenged, and I realize that everything I thought I knew about Midas might be wrong. Because these bars I&#x27;m kept in, no matter how gilded, are still just a cage.

 But the monsters on the other side might make me wish I&#x27;d never left.

 From bestselling author Raven Kennedy comes the first book in the BookTok hit Plated Prisoner series, perfect for fans of Sarah J Maas and Jennifer L Armentrout. The myth of King Midas is reimagined in this compelling adult fantasy series that is as addictive as it is unexpected.

 King Midas made me the woman I am today. Notorious. Unattainable. His.

 The thing about being confined is that you believe it&#x27;s to keep the bad out...Until you realize it&#x27;s about keeping you in.

 I&#x27;m now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won&#x27;t sit idly by and let myself wither. No, something&#x27;s bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.

 The last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.

 He&#x27;s sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he&#x27;s near? I need to tread carefully, or I risk losing much more than just my freedom.

 Regret and revenge war inside me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.

 Because I won&#x27;t be caught in a cage again. No, this time, it&#x27;ll be me setting the trap. I just hope my heart comes out of this unscathed.

 At the heart of my fear, my worry, there&#x27;s him—Commander Rip. Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.

 Fae.

 The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.

 When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason. I may be out of my cage, but I&#x27;m not free, not even close.

 In the game of kings and armies, I&#x27;m the gilded pawn. The question is, can I outmaneuver them?

 Now a major motion picture from HBO® starring Oprah Winfrey and Rose Byrne.

 One of the “most influential” (CNN), “defining” (Lit Hub), and “best” (The Philadelphia Inquirer) books of the decade.

 One of essence’s 50 most impactful Black books of the past 50 years.

 Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells - taken without her knowledge - became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than 60 years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

 Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than 20 years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family - past and present - is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

 Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family - especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rebecca Skloot/The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.jpg" alt="Cover of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</span></div>

 Bookshops &amp; Bonedust meets Our Flag Means Death in this cozy fantasy on the low seas, where lesbian pirates find out if enemies actually can become lovers!

 Kianthe and Reyna are on the hunt for dragon eggs to save their hometown—but it requires making a deal with Diarn Arlon, lord of the legendary Nacean River. Simply capture the river pirate Serina, who’s been plaguing Arlon&#x27;s supply chains, and bring her in for justice. Easy peasy.

 Begrudgingly, the couple joins forces with Bobbie, one of Arlon’s constables determined to capture the pirate. Except Bobbie and Serina have a more complicated history than anyone realized, and it might jeopardize everything.

 While Kianthe and Reyna watch this relation-shipwreck from afar, it quickly becomes apparent that these disaster lesbians need all the help they can get. Luckily, matchmaking is Reyna’s favorite pastime.

 The dragon eggs may have to wait.

Reyna and Kianthe have no trouble commanding the Realm, running a bookshop, or rescuing baby dragons...but can they save their town from the swarming influx of...tourists?!?

On the night of her kidnapping, all Reyna wanted was a relaxing cup of tea. She didn’t expect to be dropped in a hidden prison cell, but what the hells. She’s flexible.

With appropriate fanfare, Kianthe “rescues” her wife...but Reyna’s actually a terrible damsel in distress. Even worse, Reyna&#x27;s cell was booby trapped with a mysterious alchemy circle. What does a radical alchemist want with the Arcandor’s wife? And why did they think they could get away with this?

While they investigate, another problem surfaces in their hometown. Word of New Leaf Tomes and Tea—and its celebrity owners—has finally spread. Tourists are everywhere, harassing the locals and ruining the charm of Tawney. As their friends struggle with the sudden influx, Kianthe and Reyna have to face a bigger conundrum than rogue alchemists: the fact that closing their bookshop might be the only way to save their town.

 In the tradition of Legends &amp; Lattes, comes a cozy fantasy steeped in sapphic romance about one of the Queen’s private guards and a powerful mage who want to open a bookshop and live happily ever after…if only the world would let them.

 All Reyna and Kianthe want is to open a bookshop that serves tea. Worn wooden floors, plants on every table, firelight drifting between the rafters… all complemented by love and good company. Thing is, Reyna works as one of the Queen’s private guards, and Kianthe is the most powerful mage in existence. Leaving their lives isn’t so easy.

 But after an assassin takes Reyna hostage, she decides she’s thoroughly done risking her life for a self-centered queen. Meanwhile, Kianthe has been waiting for a chance to flee responsibility–all the better that her girlfriend is on board. Together, they settle in Tawney, a town nestled in the icy tundra near dragon country, and open the shop of their dreams.

 &quot;Suspenseful, sexy, and with incredibly entertaining storytelling, the first in Yarros&#x27; Empyrean series will delight fans of romantic, adventure-filled fantasy.&quot;—Booklist, starred review

 &quot;Fourth Wing will have your heart pounding from beginning to end ... A fantasy like you&#x27;ve never read before.&quot;—Jennifer L. Armentrout, #1 New York Times bestselling author

 Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros.

 Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.

 But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away … because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.

 With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.

 She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.

 Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom’s protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.

 Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rebecca Yarros/Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Fourth Wing - Empyrean, Book 1</span></div>

The second year is when the rest of us lose our humanity.&quot; Xaden Riorson

 Everyone expected Violet Sorrengail to die during her first year at Basgiath War College-Violet included. But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.

 Now the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves.

 Although Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.

 But a determination to survive won’t be enough this year. Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.

 Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves—her dragons, her family, her home, and him.

 Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.

 They need an army. They need power. They need magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find—the truth.

 But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath.

 Trian is ready to start training the first generation of Medic Sentinels, the battle-healers of their newly founded organization, and Ilea is happy to join in as a teacher (of sorts). Hopefully, her work will pay off in the birth of at least a few mini-versions of herself.

 By day, Ilea teaches the Sentinels her way of fighting and training (resistances), and by night, she applies the principles to herself. She explores supposedly very dangerous dungeons in the south and exposes herself to all manner of magics and traps, as every increased skill and resistance will help prepare her for the coming of her third class.

 It is a good routine; as long as she has mana to heal, the numbers will go up.

 However, all good grinding sessions must come to an end, the invitation of a powerful order soon pulls her back into the conflicts of humanity and beyond. With new powers and allies, she flies into a kingdom on the losing side of a war and finds things are not quite as they seem...

 Perhaps punching a lot of things really hard will once again prove to be a viable solution.

 Unfortunately, Ilea’s blood-soaked reunions are cut short when she is summoned back to Hallowfort, to help deal with a sinister corruption that is spilling out from the first layer of the Descent.

 Searching for a lost expedition, Ilea explores an ancient dungeon host to long-forgotten secrets. She will be pushed to her limit and face dangers that no one in their right mind would dare to stand against.

 Unfortunately, there aren’t too many career options for hungry brawlers. Instead, the plan is to quit her crappy fast-food job, go to college, and become a fully functioning member of society. Essentially—a fate worse than death.

 So maybe it&#x27;s lucky that she wakes up one day in a strange world where a bunch of fantasy monsters are trying to kill her?

 On the bright side, &quot;killing those monsters right back&quot; is now a viable career path! For she soon discovers her new home runs on a set of game-like rules that will allow her to punch things harder than in her wildest dreams. Well, maybe not her wildest dreams, but it’s close.

 With no quest to follow, no guide to show her the way, and no real desire to be a Hero—Ilea embarks on a journey to discover a world full of magic. Magic she can use to fight even bigger monsters.

 She’s struggling to survive, has no idea what will happen next, and is loving every minute of it. Except, and sometimes also, when she’s poisoned and/or has set herself on fire. It’s complicated.

 The trail leads Ilea to the Empire and beyond, to dark alleys and ancient dungeons, to unknown desolate lands beyond the frontiers of humanity, and to the ruins of a long-forgotten Kingdom.

 There are old allies to fight with and new ones to be made; an excellent maker of cakes, a fiery fox with a sweet tooth, and an… unlikely historian. Ilea will need all the help and levels she can get, to beat down both beast and man (and occasionally the weather too), for her enemies are many, and not every fight will be as simple as just another Drake.

 A long journey is just beginning, and she may be surprised where it ends. Hopefully, there is some good food along the way…

 She is looking for a team to rely on, to punch, and get punched by. Because every &quot;friendly yet bloody&quot; sparring match levels her resistances and makes her a little bit harder to kill. She might even stick around for a while. So long as the food is good.

 “The quartet of aging amateur sleuths…remain wonderful company.” —The New York Times Book Review

 It is an ordinary Thursday, and things should finally be returning to normal. Except trouble is never far away where the Thursday Murder Club are concerned. A decade-old cold case—their favorite kind--leads them to a local news legend and a murder with no body and no answers.

 Then a new foe pays Elizabeth a visit. Her mission? Kill or be killed. Suddenly the cold case has become red hot.

 While Elizabeth wrestles with her conscience (and a gun), Joyce, Ron, and Ibrahim chase down the clues with help from old friends and new. But can the gang solve the mystery and save Elizabeth before the murderer strikes again?

 From an upmarket spa to a prison cell complete with espresso machine to a luxury penthouse high in the sky, this third adventure of the Thursday Murder Club is full of the cleverness, intrigue, and irresistible charm that readers have come to expect from Richard Osman’s bestselling series.

 “The best Murder Club book yet. . . A poignant complement to both the fair-play mystery plot and the characters’ lively humor.”
 —The New York Times Book Review

 It&#x27;s rarely a quiet day for the Thursday Murder Club.

 Shocking news reaches them—an old friend has been killed, and a dangerous package he was protecting has gone missing.

 The gang&#x27;s search leads them into the antiques business, where the tricks of the trade are as old as the objects themselves. As they encounter drug dealers, art forgers, and online fraudsters—as well as heartache close to home—Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron, and Ibrahim have no idea whom to trust.

 With the body count rising, the clock ticking down, and trouble firmly on their tail, has their luck finally run out?

 And who will be the last devil to die?"><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Richard Osman/The Last Devil to Die - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery, Book 4.jpg" alt="Cover of The Last Devil to Die - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery, Book 4" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Last Devil to Die - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery, Book 4</span></div>

 —The New York Times Book Review

 The Bullet That Missed, the third installment in the Thursday Murder Club series, is forthcoming!

 Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim—the Thursday Murder Club—are still riding high off their recent real-life murder case and are looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet at Cooper’s Chase, their posh retirement village.

 But they are out of luck.

 An unexpected visitor—an old pal of Elizabeth’s (or perhaps more than just a pal?)—arrives, desperate for her help. He has been accused of stealing diamonds worth millions from the wrong men and he’s seriously on the lam.

 Then, as night follows day, the first body is found. But not the last. Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim are up against a ruthless murderer who wouldn’t bat an eyelid at knocking off four septuagenarians. Can our four friends catch the killer before the killer catches them? And if they find the diamonds, too? Well, wouldn’t that be a bonus? You should never put anything beyond the Thursday Murder Club.

 Richard Osman is back with everyone’s favorite mystery-solving quartet, and the second installment of the Thursday Murder Club series is just as clever and warm as the first—an unputdownable, laugh-out-loud pleasure of a read."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Richard Osman/The Man Who Died Twice - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery.jpg" alt="Cover of The Man Who Died Twice - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Man Who Died Twice - A Thursday Murder Club Mystery</span></div>

 Few great discoveries have evolved so swiftly - or have been so misunderstood. From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity, there was a span of hardly more than 25 years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project and then into the bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers - Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann - stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.

 Richard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man&#x27;s most awesome discovery and invention. The Making of the Atomic Bomb has been compared in its sweep and importance to William L. Shirer&#x27;s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It is at once a narrative tour de force and a document as powerful as its subject."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Richard Rhodes/The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition.jpg" alt="Cover of The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Making of the Atomic Bomb - 25th Anniversary Edition</span></div>

 As the son of Hades, Nico di Angelo has been through so much, from the premature deaths of his mother and sister, to being outed against his will, to losing his friend Jason during the trials of Apollo. But there is a ray of sunshine in his life—literally: his boyfriend, Will Solace, the son of Apollo. Together the two demigods can overcome any obstacle or foe.

He thinks he knows who it is: a reformed Titan named Bob whom Percy and Annabeth had to leave behind when they escaped Hades&#x27;s realm. Nico&#x27;s dreams and Rachel Dare&#x27;s latest prophecy leave little doubt in Nico&#x27;s mind that Bob is in some kind of trouble. Nico has to go on this quest, whether Mr. D and Chiron like it or not. And of course Will insists on coming with. But can a being made of light survive in the darkest part of the world? And what does the prophecy mean that Nico will have to &quot;leave something of equal value behind?&quot;

 Nico will have to face demons both internal and external as his relationship with Will is tested to the core in this standalone adventure featuring two of the most popular characters in the Percy Jackson saga.

 The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea&#x27;s army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already.

 While the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now it&#x27;s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time.

No matter how hard he tries, he can&#x27;t seem to stay out of trouble. But can he really be expected to stand by and watch while a bully picks on his scrawny best friend? Or not defend himself against his pre-algebra teacher when she turns into a monster and tries to kill him? Of course, no one believes Percy about the monster incident; he&#x27;s not even sure he believes himself. Until the Minotaur chases him to summer camp.

 Suddenly, mythical creatures seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy&#x27;s Greek mythology textbook and into his life. The gods of Mount Olympus, he&#x27;s coming to realize, are very much alive in the 21st-century. And worse, he&#x27;s angered a few of them: Zeus&#x27;s master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.

 Now Percy has just 10 days to find and return Zeus&#x27;s stolen property, and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. On a daring road trip from their summer camp in New York to the gates of the Underworld in Los Angeles, Percy and his friends, one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena, will face a host of enemies determined to stop them. To succeed in his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of failure and betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rick Riordan/The Lightning Thief - Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of The Lightning Thief - Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Lightning Thief - Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1</span></div>

With its steaming bronze dragon figurehead, Leo’s fantastical creation doesn’t appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.

 And that’s only one of her worries. In her pocket, Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving command: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to find - and close - the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?

 Annabeth’s biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if he’s now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader - but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rick Riordan/The Mark of Athena - The Heroes of Olympus, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of The Mark of Athena - The Heroes of Olympus, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Mark of Athena - The Heroes of Olympus, Book 3</span></div>

 Rick Riordan’s newest Percy Jackson adventure is full of hilarious set pieces, a diverse cast of gods and monsters, and many other delightful tricks and treats. Percy Jackson, now a high school senior, needs three recommendation letters from the Greek gods in order to get into New Rome University. He earned his first one by retrieving Ganymede’s chalice. Now the goddess Hecate has offered Percy another “opportunity”—all he has to do is pet sit her polecat, Gale, and mastiff, Hecuba, over Halloween week while she is away. Piece of cake, right?

 Percy, Annabeth, and Grover settle into Hecate’s seemingly endless mansion and start getting acquainted with the fussy, terrifying animals. The trio has been warned not to touch anything, but while Percy and Annabeth are out at school, Grover can’t resist drinking a strawberry-flavored potion in the laboratory. It turns him into a giant frenzied goat, and after he rampages through the house, damaging everything in sight, and passes out, Gale and Hecuba escape.

 Now the friends have to find Hecate’s pets and somehow restore the house, all before Hecate gets back on Saturday. It’s going to take luck, demigod wiles, and some old and new friends to hunt down the animals and set things right again."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Rick Riordan/Wrath of the Triple Goddess - Percy Jackson and the Olympians.jpg" alt="Cover of Wrath of the Triple Goddess - Percy Jackson and the Olympians" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Wrath of the Triple Goddess - Percy Jackson and the Olympians</span></div>

 Fresh from their trials in New London, Reece and his friends return victorious to the fantasy realm of Nasgar, finally armed with the location of Citadel.

 Having unlocked the godlike powers of Kono-Zemsu and raising the level cap to 99, nothing seems able to stand in their way of finally reaching home and saving the people they love.

 But things are not well upon their return.

 The dreaded Goblin Queen has resurfaced, wielding dark powers beyond anything the realm has seen before. Plus, an old nemesis from Reece’s past is laying siege to his home village as well.

 Trapped between two armies, Reece and his friends must reach the new level cap to become strong enough to overcome both foes. As darker forces conspire in the shadows, the fate of not just Citadel, but the entire realm of the Crystal Shards, may be resting in their hands.

 Will Reece be strong enough to stop them?

Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal household by his father&#x27;s gruff stableman. An outcast whose existence has forced his father to abdicate his claim on the throne, Fitz is ignored by all royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin.

Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission, a mission that poses as much a threat to himself as it does for his target---for Fitz is a threat to the throne...but he may also be the key to the survival of the kingdom."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Robin Hobb/The Farseer- Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice.jpg" alt="Cover of The Farseer: Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Farseer: Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice</span></div>

 “A superb suspense writer…Brava, Ruth Ware. I daresay even Henry James would be impressed.” (Maureen Corrigan, author of So We Read On)

 “This appropriately twisty Turn of the Screw update finds the Woman in Cabin 10 author in her most menacing mode, unfurling a shocking saga of murder and deception.” (Entertainment Weekly)

 From the number one New York Times best-selling author of The Lying Game and The Death of Mrs. Westaway comes this thrilling novel that explores the dark side of technology.

 When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely.

 But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss - a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten - by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.

 What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare - one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.

 Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the home&#x27;s cameras, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman.

 It was everything.

 She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty - at least not of murder - but somebody is. Which means someone else is.

 Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, The Turn of the Key is an pause-resisting thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Ruth Ware/The Turn of the Key.jpg" alt="Cover of The Turn of the Key" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Turn of the Key</span></div>

Yet, peace is fleeting in a world where magic and danger intertwine.

 The arrival of Aslishtei&#x27;s nieces brings an unexpected proposition: an expedition to Old Baxteiyel. The hierophant of Albei has turned the ruins into the site of a deadly race, pitting teams against one another to claim the treasures hidden within. But Aslishtei&#x27;s nieces have a different plan. For them, the race is a distraction—a cover for their true goal of uncovering the secrets of the fabled Arc of Knowledge within the ruins.

 The journey is fraught with peril. Dark warriors guard Old Baxteiyel&#x27;s mysteries, and the Maltran Empire&#x27;s agents lurk in the shadows, intent on sabotage and spreading chaos. As Eight and his team delve into the ruins, they face battles not only with the ruins&#x27; defenders but also with their own doubts and desires. For Eight, the expedition is more than an adventure; it&#x27;s a confrontation with his growing yearning for the unknown and the toll it takes on those he loves, particularly Ikfael, who cannot stray for long from her territory.

 The clash with Baxteiyel&#x27;s dark warriors changes everything. The choices made and bonds tested in the ruins send ripples far beyond the battlefield, leaving Eight to grapple with the aftermath and the profound shift in his relationship with Ikfael.

With wisdom, courage, and a healthy dash of magic.

 When a murderer-turned-monster escapes, the evil once restrained now roams free, leaving death in his wake. Inleio, the former lodge master, has fallen, and the responsibility to avenge his death lands squarely on Eight&#x27;s shoulders.

 The chase is treacherous and wild, leading Eight and his hunter team to the nearby city of Albei. There, they face more than just their prey. Political schemes, intrigues from the rival Healer&#x27;s Lodge, and even assassins threaten to derail their mission.

 The stakes are higher, the enemies fiercer, and the Long Dark&#x27;s shadow looms ever closer. Can Eight&#x27;s years of wisdom, honed skills, and sheer determination carry him through? He&#x27;s faced hungry beasts, explored the wilderness, and survived first contact with civilization. But this time, the challenge is greater, the danger more insidious.

 Eight 3: Undaunted is a novel of pursuit and peril, of urban struggles, and of a relentless dance with life, death, and magic. It&#x27;s an adventure that tests the very essence of Eight&#x27;s being. Join him as he faces his most daunting challenge yet, but remember, in the game of survival, even the wise can fall, and the Long Dark waits for no one."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Samer Rabadi/Eight- Undaunted - Eight, Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Eight: Undaunted - Eight, Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Eight: Undaunted - Eight, Book 3</span></div>

 He’s carved a home out in the wilderness, and met its inhabitants, killing some and making friends with others. Things are looking downright cozy—in a bushcraft kind of way—but there’s a village to the east with tools, resources, and new magic to learn. That’s all incredibly tempting when living among the wild things.

 Where there are people though, there are complications, including the murder-y kind.

 Add a few ghosts, giant beasts, and a new god too, and...well...life’s hard for an old man trapped in a young boy’s body. And things are about to get much, much tougher. Still, all that wisdom and experience have to count for something, right?

 Eight: The Way of the Hunter is part mystery, part ghost story, and all adventure.

 Introducing Audible&#x27;s Thriller of the Year: Silent Child by Sarah A. Denzil, performed by Joanne Froggatt.

 In the summer of 2006, Emma Price watched helplessly as her six-year-old son&#x27;s red coat was fished out of the River Ouse. It was the tragic story of the year - a little boy, Aiden, wandered away from school during a terrible flood, fell into the river, and drowned. His body was never recovered. Ten years later Emma has finally rediscovered the joy in life. She&#x27;s married, pregnant, and in control again...until Aiden returns.

 Too traumatised to speak, he raises endless questions and answers none. Where has he been? What happened to him on that rainy afternoon? And now that he&#x27;s back, whom can he trust?

 At Audible we love listening to crime books. But every so often one comes along that we think is truly special. An Amazon Kindle number one best-seller, Sarah A. Denzil&#x27;s Silent Child is taking Audible HQ by storm. In an Audible Exclusive production, Joanne Froggatt (Mrs Bates, Downton Abbey) delivers a powerhouse performance that will keep you gripped until the very last second."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Sarah A.

 The bestselling phenomenon, When the Moon Hatched, is a fast-paced fantasy romance featuring an immersive, vibrant world with mysterious creatures, a unique magic system, and a love that blazes through the ages.

 The Creators did not expect their beloved dragons to sail skyward upon their end. To curl into balls just beyond gravity’s grip, littering the sky with tombstones. With moons. They certainly did not expect them to FALL.

 As an assassin for the rebellion group Fíur du Ath, Raeve’s job is to complete orders and never get caught. When a rival bounty hunter turns her world upside down, blood spills, hearts break, and Raeve finds herself imprisoned by the Guild of Nobles—a group of powerful fae who turn her into a political statement.

 Crushed by the loss of his great love, Kaan Vaegor took the head of a king and donned his melted crown. Now on a tireless quest to quell the never-ebbing ache in his chest, he is lured by a clue into the capitol’s high-security prison where he stumbles upon the imprisoned Raeve....

 Echoes of the past race between them.

 There’s more to their story than meets the eye, but some truths are too poisonous to swallow.

 &quot;&quot;A wild ride that thrills as much as it enchants . . . This remarkable book is an instant classic.” — Thea Guanzon, New York Times bestselling author of The Hurricane Wars

 “When The Moon Hatched breathes new, beautiful life into the genre, as Sarah A. Parker weaves lyrical prose with undeniable chemistry. I laughed, I cried, I got everything out of this. It’s an absolutely stunning fantasy world that everyone should sink their teeth into.” — Raven Kennedy, internationally bestselling author of The Plated Prisoner series

Maas, bridging the events of A Court of Wings and Ruin and upcoming audiobooks.

 Feyre, Rhysand, and their friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly altered world beyond, recovering from the war that changed everything. But Winter Solstice is finally approaching, and with it, the joy of a hard-earned reprieve.

 Yet even the festive atmosphere can&#x27;t keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, her concern for those dearest to her deepens. They have more wounds than she anticipated-scars that will have a far-reaching impact on the future of their court.

 A Court of Frost and Starlight explores the far-reaching effects of a devastating war and the fierce love between friends.

 Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she’s now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.

 As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre’s hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different people: one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future?and the future of a world in turmoil.

Maas&#x27;s sexy, richly imagined audio experience continues with the journey of Feyre&#x27;s fiery sister, Nesta.

 Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she&#x27;s struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can&#x27;t seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.

 The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre&#x27;s Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta&#x27;s orbit. But her temper isn&#x27;t the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.

 Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.

 Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing—in each other&#x27;s arms.

But her temper isn&#x27;t the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.

 Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.

 Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance—and healing—in each other&#x27;s arms.

Maas, read by Elizabeth Evans.

 Never trust an assassin.

 Celaena’s story continues in this second book in the #1 bestselling Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas.

 Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become the King’s Champion. But she is far from loyal to the crown. Though she goes to great lengths to hide her secret, her deadly charade becomes more difficult when she realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. Her search for answers ensnares those closest to her, and no one is safe from suspicion—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a princess with a rebel heart.

 Then, one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena’s world shatters, she will be forced to decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie . . . and what she is willing to fight for.

 The second book in the #1 New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series returns listeners to a land destroyed by liars, where one woman’s truth is the only thing that can save them all."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Sarah J.

Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance.

 Bryce Quinlan had the perfect life-working hard all day and partying all night - until a demon murdered her closest friends, leaving her bereft, wounded, and alone. When the accused is behind bars but the crimes start up again, Bryce finds herself at the heart of the investigation. She&#x27;ll do whatever it takes to avenge their deaths.

 Hunt Athalar is a notorious Fallen angel, now enslaved to the Archangels he once attempted to overthrow. His brutal skills and incredible strength have been set to one purpose - to assassinate his boss&#x27; enemies, no questions asked. But with a demon wreaking havoc in the city, he&#x27;s offered an irresistible deal: help Bryce find the murderer, and his freedom will be within reach.

 As Bryce and Hunt dig deep into Crescent City&#x27;s underbelly, they discover a dark power that threatens everything and everyone they hold dear, and they find, in each other, a blazing passion - one that could set them both free, if they&#x27;d only let it.

 With unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and pause-resisting suspense, this richly inventive new fantasy series by number one global bestselling author Sarah J. Maas delves into the heartache of loss, the price of freedom - and the power of love."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Sarah J.

 In a land without magic, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She has no love for the vicious king who rules from his throne of glass, but she has not come to kill him. She has come to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three murderers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she will be released from prison to serve as the King’s Champion.

 The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. And a princess from a faraway country will befriend her. But something rotten dwells in the castle, and it’s there to kill. When her competitors start dying mysteriously, one by one, Celaena’s fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival—and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.

 “Deliciously impossible to put down.”—Jodi Picoult

 “Addictive.”—Ali Hazelwood

 “A gripping inheritance drama, wrapped around a swoony summer romance.”—The New York Times Book Review

 Alice Storm hasn’t been welcome at her family’s magnificent private island off the Rhode Island coast in five years—not since she was cast out and built her life beyond the Storm name, influence, and untold billions. But the shocking death of her larger-than-life father changes everything.

 Alice plans to keep her head down, pay her final respects (such as they are), and leave the minute the funeral is over. Unfortunately, her father had other plans. The eccentric, manipulative patriarch left his family a final challenge—an inheritance game designed to upend their world. The rules are clear: spend one week on the island, complete their assigned tasks, and receive the inheritance.

 But a whole week on Storm Island is no easy task for Alice. Every corner of the sprawling old house is bursting with chaos: Her older sister’s secret love affair. Her brother’s unyielding arrogance. Her younger sister’s constant analysis of the vibes. Her mother’s cold judgment. And all under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father’s intriguing and too-handsome second-in-command. It will be a miracle if Alice manages to escape unscathed.

 A smart and tender story about the transformative power of grief, love, and family, this luscious novel explores past secrets, present truths, and futures forged in the wake of wild summer storms."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Sarah Maclean/These Summer Storms - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of These Summer Storms - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>These Summer Storms - A Novel</span></div>

 The instant New York Times and #1 international bestseller. “You should read Behind Her Eyes…It’s bloody brilliant.”—Stephen King

 &quot;An eerie thriller…Pinborough keeps us guessing about just who’s manipulating whom–until the ending reveals that we’ve been wholly complicit in this terrifying mind game.”—The New York Times Book Review

 Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough&#x27;s Behind Her Eyes?

 Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she’s thrilled she finally connected with someone.

 When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar…who says the kiss was a terrible mistake, but who still can’t keep his eyes off Louise.

 And then Louise bumps into Adele, who’s new to town and in need of a friend. But she also just happens to be married to David. And if you think you know where this story is going, think again, because Behind Her Eyes is like no other book you’ve heard before.

 David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife. But then why is David so controlling? And why is Adele so scared of him?

 As Louise is drawn into David and Adele’s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong. But Louise can’t guess how wrong—and how far a person might go to protect their marriage’s secrets.

 In Behind Her Eyes, Sarah Pinborough has written a novel that takes the modern day love triangle and not only turns it on its head, but completely reinvents it in a way that will leave listeners reeling."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Sarah Pinborough/Behind Her Eyes - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Behind Her Eyes - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Behind Her Eyes - A Novel</span></div>

In this case, it was looking to be enough of them to fill an entire calendar.

 It seemed the unthinkable had happened. Someone had actually targeted the Ghalian, an order of assassins known and feared across the systems. It was madness. Only a fool would go after the likes of them. But, it seemed, the galaxy had no shortage of fools.

 Retaliation most bloody was in order, and one man stood ready to spring into action. Hozark was his name, and he was no ordinary man. He was a Master Ghalian, an assassin skilled in the ways of death. Practical, mechanical, magical, to him it made no difference. One way or another, he would get to the bottom of the attack and turn the tables on whoever dared strike out at his brothers and sisters.

 Or so he thought until someone quite unexpected reared their head. An appearance that gave him pause. Someone he had thought long dead. His former lover. A revelation like that could throw even a master assassin for a loop. That she too was an assassin only complicated things more.

 There was far more at play than was apparent on the surface, and Hozark would require all of his wits and skill to get to the bottom of it. And he most surely intended to do just that, no matter how high the body count. He just hoped to do so before more of his kin fell victim to the nefarious plot.

 A sci-fantasy adventure across space, with magic, starships, sword battles, treachery, deadly beasts, and, of course, a healthy dose of snark and sarcasm."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Scott Baron/Space Assassins Box Set- The Complete Series, Books 1-5.jpg" alt="Cover of Space Assassins Box Set: The Complete Series, Books 1-5" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Space Assassins Box Set: The Complete Series, Books 1-5</span></div>

Daisy&#x27;s life just got a whole lot more complicated.

 As if nearly burning up in a freak accident on her way to Earth wasn&#x27;t bad enough, Daisy had a whole mess of other trouble on her plate. Big trouble. And she was going to get to the bottom of it if it was the last thing she&#x27;d do, which it was starting to look like it very well might be.

 The thing is, Daisy had a simple rule for space travel. Don&#x27;t blow up, and so far she&#x27;d been managing to abide by that, but mere survival wasn&#x27;t enough.

 With the powerful AI supercomputer guiding the craft beginning to show some disconcerting quirks of its own, and its unsettling cyborg assistant nosing into her affairs, Daisy&#x27;s unease was rapidly growing, as was her bigotry toward artificially intelligent beings. Add to the mix a crew of mechanically enhanced humans, any one of whom she suspected might not be what they seemed, and Daisy found herself with a sense of pending dread tickling the periphery of her mind.

 Something was very much not right, she could feel it in her bones. The tricky part now was going to be overcoming her biases and figuring out what the threat was, before it could manifest from a mere sinking feeling in her gut into a potentially deadly reality. Only things were quite different and much worse than she could ever have imagined, forcing her to repeatedly adjust and overcome a reality that turned out to be far from what it had originally seemed. And it was looking like Daisy wouldn&#x27;t have to save only herself, but the entire planet Earth in the process.

 Martin Banks is just a normal guy who has made an abnormal discovery: he can manipulate reality, thanks to reality being nothing more than a computer program. With every use of this ability, though, Martin finds his little “tweaks” have not escaped notice. Rather than face prosecution, he decides instead to travel back in time to the Middle Ages and pose as a wizard.

 An American hacker in King Arthur’s court, Martin must now train to become a full-fledged master of his powers, discover the truth behind the ancient wizard Merlin…and not, y’know, die or anything."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Scott Meyer/Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Off to Be the Wizard - Magic 2.0, Book 1</span></div>

 In the magical world of Pallos, Elaine can finally breathe for a moment after the horrors of the Han Civil War. Engaged to the love of her life, Iona, Elaine believes she has found peace. However, the tranquility is shattered when three formidable phoenixes descend from the Phoenix Peaks, claiming Auri must go with them for her own good. With heavy hearts, Elaine and Iona watch as Auri disappears into the sky, bound by a promise to return.

 War is brewing in the background, as civilization moves firmly into the crystalized era, where the easy expansion of nations and Immortals start to bump into each other, interests colliding. The wilderness is beaten back, and the era of easy expansion is coming to an end.

 As days melt into weeks, Elaine refuses to stay idle. She makes new divine friends, finally coming into contact with the Goddess of Healing. She immerses herself in the arcane arts at the revered Jakhong Monastery and delves deeper into magic at the School of Sorcery and Spellcraft, her powers growing as rapidly as her concern for Auri. When the agreed timeline expires without a sign of Auri, Elaine&#x27;s worry transforms into resolve. Armed with newly honed wizardry skills and a heart full of determination, the Eventide Eclipse sets out on a perilous journey to the Phoenix Peaks to uncover the truth and bring Auri home.

 What mysteries await Elaine at the Phoenix Peaks? Why has Auri not returned? Join Elaine as she navigates a path filled with magic, adventure, and danger, proving that the bonds of love and friendship can challenge the mightiest of fates."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Selkie Myth/The Phoenix Peaks - Beneath the Dragoneye Moons, Book 12.jpg" alt="Cover of The Phoenix Peaks - Beneath the Dragoneye Moons, Book 12" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Phoenix Peaks - Beneath the Dragoneye Moons, Book 12</span></div>

 Amina al-Sirafi should be content. After a storied and scandalous career as one of the Indian Ocean’s most notorious pirates, she’s survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon to retire peacefully with her family to a life of piety, motherhood, and absolutely nothing that hints of the supernatural.

 But when she’s tracked down by the obscenely wealthy mother of a former crewman, she’s offered a job no bandit could refuse: retrieve her comrade’s kidnapped daughter for a kingly sum. The chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her family’s future forever? It seems like such an obvious choice that it must be God’s will.

 Yet the deeper Amina dives, the more it becomes alarmingly clear there’s more to this job, and the girl’s disappearance, than she was led to believe. For there’s always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, to savor just a bit more power…and the price might be your very soul.

 It all started at a dinner party. . .

 A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors—a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .

 Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they&#x27;ve kept for years.

 What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family—a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Shari Lapena/The Couple Next Door - A Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of The Couple Next Door - A Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Couple Next Door - A Novel</span></div>

With the Breeder&#x27;s Den destroyed and most of Goblin&#x27;s Gorge&#x27;s resources devoted to rebuilding, his best hope lies in creating an army of golems. But for that, he needs Viridium, a rare metal that can only be obtained from hobgoblin towns, where Oren and his clan of goblins are viewed as nothing more than potential slaves. To make his way in the game, and to defeat his former guild, Oren&#x27;s ingenuity alone will not be enough. He will need to conquer his deepest fears and tap into his inner monster.

 Following the devastating attack on Yaresh, its people are left to pick up the pieces. The city lies in ruins, but its decimated defenders have more to deal with than just reconstruction. Jason&#x27;s actions during the battle have brought unwelcome attention from allies and enemies alike. While the adventurers question his loyalty, the messengers question his very nature. Both have designs on Jason that he intends to thwart, but a danger comes to light that shifts everyone&#x27;s agenda.

 Deep underground, a hidden civilization has survived by tapping into a long-buried power. That power&#x27;s growing instability has become both a threat and an opportunity to the warring surface factions. Neither side can stop or claim the power alone, leading to an uneasy alliance with a reluctant Jason at the center. The adventurers, messengers, and Jason himself all have intentions for the power but little idea what awaits them below ground. There are more players involved than any of them realize, and soon, they will have greater problems than each other.

 Both they and their enemies are scattered across a strange realm, one that someone must conquer if anyone is to get out alive. Territory by territory, factions fight to reunite their people and conquer the realm.

 Jason must contend with alliances he doesn’t want, friends he cannot find, and enemies ranging from angelic despots to the power of an undead god. He must face a realm that has been warped by his own mind and find a way to save a friend whose sacrifice got them this far.

 To have any chance against the enemies waiting for him, Jason will have to confront the power inside himself that he’s been unwilling to face, fearful of what he’ll become. Only by accepting the destiny that looms over him will he have the strength to face his foes, with no promise even that will be enough to defeat them."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Shirtaloon/He Who Fights with Monsters 11- A LitRPG Adventure.jpg" alt="Cover of He Who Fights with Monsters 11: A LitRPG Adventure - He Who Fights with Monsters, Book 11" loading="lazy" /></button><span>He Who Fights with Monsters 11: A LitRPG Adventure - He Who Fights with Monsters, Book 11</span></div>

 He was promised a life of wandering his new home and having adventures, but things got out of hand pretty quickly. He met with kings and gods, fought interdimensional cults, and got in a knife fight with the guy who creates universes. He didn&#x27;t win. What he&#x27;d never done was roam around, having nice, sensible adventures. He hadn&#x27;t even seen the hometown of his friends, and that had been the first destination on his list.

 Two decades on, he&#x27;d saved whole civilizations and the Earth, several times. He was freshly returned from a conflict with the fate of the cosmos at stake, where the battlefield was his soul and the combatants were the governing forces of reality. It was a fight he had no chance of winning, which was why he rigged it and pinched the prize while everyone was distracted.

 Now, Jason is determined to reunite with his friends and have the simple adventuring life he always wanted. He won&#x27;t let anyone get in his way, not angelic armies, scheming guilds, or the people who want to talk about that time he altered the fundamental laws of magic. Which isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds, he promises.

 Jason&#x27;s taking a gap year, whatever he has to do to make it happen. Manipulate a prestigious noble house into liberating a slave town. Attempt to extort every government on the planet. Blow up and subsequently rebuild the occasional city. Gods help anyone who tries to stop him, but the gods probably won&#x27;t because they&#x27;ve met Jason and they know how that usually goes.

 With the authorities fulfilling their responsibilities (for once), he looks forward to some quiet time to rest and recuperate.

 The locals might not find ceaseless monster onslaughts and an interdimensional invasion relaxing, but Jason has had a rough few years. He&#x27;s doing his best to let go of his anger.

 While his team is caught up in duty, Jason has no shortage of people looking to interfere with his rest. Enemies—old and new—are circling, and even would-be allies are trouble. A princess finds him inconveniently alive, an ancient king arrives at his barbecue, and the local Church of Fertility are uncomfortably enthusiastic about including him in their practices. As his friends strive to reach him from the far side of the world, they are all frustrated by obstacles.

 Jason is finally back in the world he longed for, but he is not the same man he was when he left. As the pressure on him mounts, allies and enemies alike will find that out the hard way."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Shirtaloon/He Who Fights with Monsters 7.jpg" alt="Cover of He Who Fights with Monsters 7 - A LitRPG Adventure (He Who Fights with Monsters, Book 7)" loading="lazy" /></button><span>He Who Fights with Monsters 7 - A LitRPG Adventure (He Who Fights with Monsters, Book 7)</span></div>

 He’ll face off against cannibals, cultists, wizards, monsters...and that’s just on the first day. He’s going to need courage, he’s going to need wit, and he’s going to need some magic powers of his own. But first, he’s going to need pants.

 Worse, his only weapon is a magical branding iron, which seems to have one skill and one skill only, to overwrite slave brands. Thing is, monster girls seem pretty grateful about being freed from the tyranny of their masters, and with each one he brands, the stronger he becomes.

 A brand-new audio event set in the Audible and New York Times best-selling Alliances universe of legendary creator Stan Lee, performed by fan favorite Wil Wheaton.

 Biohacker Olivia Park is obsessed with an emerging mystery within Oz, the online portal created by alien technology. What she finds is a primitive xenobot, Eno, who takes her on a mind-bending trip through time that begins as the Berlin Wall is falling, and takes her back to the origins of the modern internet and the fall of a digital Atlantis created by her father, Wesley Park, and entrepreneur William Ackerson.

 A New Reality expands Stan Lee’s final science fiction universe in new and unexpected ways, exploring the early global computing boom of the 1990s through the eyes of two well-meaning visionaries whose innovations introduce the world to the promise, power, and perils of connectivity - and whose original sins could destroy it all."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Stan Lee/Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances- A New Reality.jpg" alt="Cover of Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances: A New Reality" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Stan Lee&#x27;s Alliances: A New Reality</span></div>

 In one of Stan Lee’s final collaborations and most innovative works, the legendary creator invites you to unleash the power of your imagination, and bring to life an epic, superhero origin story set within a tech-centric, highly connected world, unnervingly reminiscent of our own.

 Narrated by Yara Shahidi, one of today’s brightest talents, Stan Lee’s Alliances: A Trick of Light introduces listeners to a mysterious young woman, Nia, whose fate is intertwined with a seemingly ordinary Midwestern teenager, Cameron Ackerson, whose quest for YouTube stardom takes him to the heart of the Great Lakes Triangle where he is imbued with the power to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot; a new reality.

 As Nia and Cameron’s relationship grows, they conspire to create a more righteous online universe, but wind up crossing a shadowy outfit called OPTIC. Meanwhile, a threat of galactic proportions emerges, imperiling humanity’s very existence by harnessing our individual desire to connect as the very means to destroy us.

 Can Nia, Cameron, and Juaquo (Cameron’s best friend) save us from our own collective ruin?

But weekly visits to her mother still fill Elle with a paralyzing fear she can’t explain. It’s just another of so many unanswered questions she grew up with in a family estranged by silence and secrets.

 Elle’s world turns upside down when she receives a deathbed request from her grandfather, a man she was told had died years ago. Racked by grief, regrets, and a haunted conscience, he has a tale of his own to tell Elle: about her mother, an imaginary friend, and two strangers who came to the house one night and never left.

 Welcome, welcome to Caraval - Stephanie Garber&#x27;s sweeping tale of two sisters who escape their ruthless father when they enter the dangerous intrigue of a legendary game.

 Scarlett has never left the tiny island where she and her beloved sister, Tella, live with their powerful - and cruel - father. Now Scarlett&#x27;s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval, the faraway once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show, are over.

 But this year Scarlett&#x27;s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval&#x27;s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season&#x27;s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.

 Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. But she nevertheless becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic with the other players in the game. And whether Caraval is real or not, she must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over, a dangerous domino effect of consequences is set off, and her sister disappears forever."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Stephanie Garber/Caraval.jpg" alt="Cover of Caraval" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Caraval</span></div>

 Master storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this #1 New York Times bestselling and spellbinding novel about a young man who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours.

 Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a horrific accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from that shed.

 Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Stephen King/Fairy Tale.jpg" alt="Cover of Fairy Tale" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Fairy Tale</span></div>

 Marianne has a life others dream of. A beautiful townhouse on the best street in the neighbourhood. Three bright children who are her pride and joy.

 Sometimes her past still hurts: losing her mother early, growing up in foster care. But her husband, Simon, is always there. A successful surgeon, he’s the envy of every woman they’ve ever met. Flowers, gifts, trips to France: nothing is too good for his family.

 Then Simon says another woman’s name. The way he lingers on it, Caroline, gives Marianne a shudder of suspicion, but she knows it’s nothing - she can’t entertain this flash of paranoia.

 In the old days, she’d have distracted herself by excelling at work, but Marianne left her glamorous career when she married. She’d speak to a friend, but she’s too busy with her children and besides, Simon doesn’t approve of the few she has left.

 It’s almost by accident that Marianne starts to learn more about Caroline. But once started, she can’t stop, because what she finds makes her wonder: is the question she should be asking not &quot;should I be jealous&quot; but...&quot;should I be scared?&quot;

 to lose everything you love,

 what is there left to fight for?

 As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes.

 Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves.

 When Haymitch&#x27;s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He&#x27;s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who&#x27;s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he&#x27;s been set up to fail. But there&#x27;s something in him that wants to fight . . . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Suzanne Collins/Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel.jpg" alt="Cover of Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Sunrise on the Reaping - A Hunger Games Novel</span></div>

 The New York Times | USA Today | The Globe and Mail | The Toronto Star

 New York Times bestselling author Tarryn Fisher delivers a pulse-pounding, fast-paced suspense novel that will leave you breathless. A thriller you won’t be able to put down!

 Imagine that your husband has two other wives.

 You’ve never met the other wives. None of you know each other, and because of this unconventional arrangement, you can see your husband only one day a week. But you love him so much you don’t care. Or at least that’s what you’ve told yourself.

 But one day, while you’re doing laundry, you find a scrap of paper in his pocket—an appointment reminder for a woman named Hannah, and you just know it’s another of the wives.

 You thought you were fine with your arrangement, but you can’t help yourself: you track her down, and, under false pretenses, you strike up a friendship. Hannah has no idea who you really are. Then Hannah starts showing up to your coffee dates with telltale bruises, and you realize she’s being abused by her husband. Who, of course, is also your husband. But you’ve never known him to be violent, ever.

 Who exactly is your husband, and how far would you be willing to go to find out?

 And who is his mysterious third wife?

 “NASA? Space missions? The ’80s? This is a collection of all the things I love.”—Andy Weir, author of Project Hail Mary and The Martian

 Joan Goodwin has been obsessed with the stars for as long as she can remember. Thoughtful and reserved, Joan is content with her life as a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and as aunt to her precocious niece, Frances. That is, until she comes across an advertisement seeking the first women scientists to join NASA’s space shuttle program. Suddenly, Joan burns to be one of the few people to go to space.

 Selected from a pool of thousands of applicants in the summer of 1980, Joan begins training at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, alongside an exceptional group of fellow candidates: Top Gun pilot Hank Redmond and scientist John Griffin, who are kind and easygoing even when the stakes are highest; mission specialist Lydia Danes, who has worked too hard to play nice; warmhearted Donna Fitzgerald, who is navigating her own secrets; and Vanessa Ford, the magnetic and mysterious aeronautical engineer, who can fix any engine and fly any plane.

 As the new astronauts become unlikely friends and prepare for their first flights, Joan finds a passion and a love she never imagined. In this new light, Joan begins to question everything she thinks she knows about her place in the observable universe.

 Then, in December of 1984, on mission STS-LR9, it all changes in an instant.

 Minalan gave up a promising career as a professional warmage to live the quiet life of a village spellmonger in the remote mountain valley of Boval. It was a peaceful, beautiful little fief, far from the dangerous feudal petty squabbles of the Five Duchies, on the world of Callidore. There were cows. Lots of cows. And cheese.

 For six months things went well: He found a quaint little shop, he befriended the local lord, the village folk loved him, he found a sharp young apprentice to help out, and, best yet, he met a comely young widow with the prettiest eyes.

 Then one night Minalan is forced to pick up his mageblade again to defend his adopted home from the vanguard of an army of goblins - gurvani, they call themselves - bent on a genocidal crusade against all mankind. And that was the good news. The bad news was that their shamans were armed with more magical power than has been seen since the days of the ancient Imperial Magocracy - and their leader, a mysterious, vengeful force of hate and dark magic, is headed directly to Boval Vale, along with a massive invading army of gurvani. The good people of Boval and their spellmonger have only one choice: To hole up in the over-sized Boval Castle and hope they can endure a siege against hundreds of thousands of goblins.

 When the people look to him for hope, Minalan does his best, but the odds are depressing: There are multitudes of goblins, and they want Boval Vale as a staging ground for a vengeful invasion of the whole Five Duchies. Add to his troubles a jealous rival mage, a motley band of mercenaries, a delusional liege lord who insists victory is at hand despite the hordes at his door, a dour castellan, a moody, pregnant girlfriend, and a catty ex-girlfriend who specializes in sex magic - all trapped in a stinking, besieged castle with no hope of rescue, and you&#x27;ll understand why Minalan is willing to take his chances with the goblins.

 All that stands between the gurvani horde and the people of the Five Duchies is one tired, overwhelmed baker&#x27;s son who wanted nothing more than to be a simple village spellmonger."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Terry Mancour/Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Spellmonger - Spellmonger, Book 1</span></div>

 Eliza&#x27;s parents are relentless - forcing her to constantly take extra courses to prepare for college and medical school. Sometimes, it feels like her entire life has already been planned out.

 Which is why she leaps at the chance to escape into a new virtual reality game, Awaken Online. What she wasn&#x27;t expecting was to encounter a capricious god and his loyal &quot;pet&quot;.

 Yet she just can&#x27;t shake the feeling that there is more to the irritating god than first meets the eye.

That is, until his daughter intervenes, forcing him out of his grief and into a new virtual reality game developed by his old employer.

 Now Finn must learn to fight, for his own life and a chance at redemption. He&#x27;ll need to prove that his fire hasn&#x27;t been snuffed out.

 When an injury throws a young, battle-hungry orc off her chosen path, she may find that what we need isn&#x27;t always what we seek.

 Set in the world of New York Times bestselling Legends &amp; Lattes, Travis Baldree&#x27;s Bookshops &amp; Bonedust takes us on a journey of high fantasy, first loves, and second-hand books.

 Viv&#x27;s career with the notorious mercenary company Rackam&#x27;s Ravens isn&#x27;t going as planned.

 Wounded during the hunt for a powerful necromancer, she&#x27;s packed off against her will to recuperate in the sleepy beach town of Murk—so far from the action that she worries she&#x27;ll never be able to return to it.

 What&#x27;s a thwarted soldier of fortune to do?

 Spending her hours at a beleaguered bookshop in the company of its foul-mouthed proprietor is the last thing Viv would have predicted, but it may be both exactly what she needs and the seed of changes she couldn&#x27;t possibly imagine.

 Still, adventure isn&#x27;t all that far away. A suspicious traveler in gray, a gnome with a chip on her shoulder, a summer fling, and an improbable number of skeletons prove Murk to be more eventful than Viv could have ever expected.

 “Take a break from epic battles and saving the world. This is a low-stakes fantasy that delivers exactly what&#x27;s advertised: a wholesome, cozy novel that feels like a warm hug. This is my new comfort read.”—Genevieve Gornichec, author of The Witch&#x27;s Heart, on Legends &amp; Lattes

 This program is read by the author.

 The much-beloved BookTok sensation, Travis Baldree&#x27;s Legends &amp; Lattes, is novel of high fantasy and low stakes.

 Come take a load off at Viv&#x27;s cafe, the first &amp; only coffee shop in Thune. Grand opening!

 Worn out after decades of packing steel and raising hell, Viv, the orc barbarian, cashes out of the warrior’s life with one final score. A forgotten legend, a fabled artifact, and an unreasonable amount of hope lead her to the streets of Thune, where she plans to open the first coffee shop the city has ever seen.

 However, her dreams of a fresh start filling mugs instead of swinging swords are hardly a sure bet. Old frenemies and Thune’s shady underbelly may just upset her plans. To finally build something that will last, Viv will need some new partners, and a different kind of resolve.

 A hot cup of fantasy, slice-of-life with a dollop of romantic froth.

 Early Years, book one:

 I never believed in the whole “light at the end of the tunnel” folly where people, after having a near-death experience, would startle awake in a cold sweat exclaiming, “I saw the light!” But there I was, in this so-called “tunnel” facing a glaring light, when the last thing I remembered was sleeping in my room - the royal bed-chamber, as others called it. Had I died? If so, how?

 King Grey once benefited from unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability but now finds himself reborn in a society dominated by magic. Given a second chance at life, the once-king strives to understand his role in this new world and the purpose of his reincarnation while correcting the mistakes of his past.

 New Heights, book two:

 I had a family now, I had people who loved me. It was a feeling I never wanted to give up. I’d treasure it, fight for it if I had to...and for that, I needed to better myself. More so even than when I had been a king.

 Given a second chance at life, Arthur Leywin wishes above all to grow strong enough to protect his family, as the memory of his cold and disconnected past life as King Grey still haunts him. To this end, Arthur adopts the persona of the masked adventurer, Note, and delves into the dungeons under the forbidding Beast Glades. On his adventures, Arthur discovers a strange magical blade that responds to the dragon’s will inside him, befriends a powerful young conjurer whose past is shrouded in mystery, and battles the deadly Elderwood Guardian. Yet all his efforts might prove for naught when Arthur makes an enemy of a talented conjurer from a very powerful family, putting his very future at risk."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/Turtleme/The Beginning After the End- Publisher&#x27;s Pack.jpg" alt="Cover of The Beginning After the End: Publisher&#x27;s Pack" loading="lazy" /></button><span>The Beginning After the End: Publisher&#x27;s Pack</span></div>

 There are no cheats for her. There are no gods to guide her, and some would even laugh in her face. But the pain, the hardships, and the challenges only give her strength. As the first Cursed Berserker seen in over a hundred years, Amber welcomes the world of Vir with a smile on her face.

 And she will not be satisfied until she is the strongest.

 The Sacred Forest, that is Amber’s destination after her attempted exile in the capital. But her journey won’t be simple. The Black Rose wants her for an important plan that will happen at her destination. A plan that will endanger those involved, and unbeknownst to her draw the ire of an Archmage—a mage capable of using Level 400 magic. And as if that wasn’t enough trouble, a high-level member of the Arcane Council wants something from her.

 Meanwhile, the world as a whole is in turmoil. The Republic of Mercenaries has been turned upside down thanks to Oracle’s schemes, and to top it off the Primordial Spirit of the region has been missing, but all of this is not something that directly concerns Amber.

 At least, not until she finds herself venturing towards the Primordial Spirit tower in the Republic of Mercenaries in need of something important, where great and difficult trials await her. Where once more, she will have no choice but to risk her life for her goals.

 But Amber will overcome it all, whether it is the troubles in the Sacred Forest, or the status quo of the Republic of Mercenaries; she will come out stronger."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/V.a.

Abrams and Doug Dorst conceived of a multi-layered novel-within-a-novel that involves handwritten notes in the margins and physical objects slipped between the pages. Because an audio edition is unable to recreate those innately visual pieces of the story and the intended experience of S., the text of Ship of Theseus has been recorded here. Award-winning actor Graeme Malcolm reads the work of an incendiary novelist who may never have existed at all.

 What is Ship of Theseus, and who is its mysterious author V.M. Straka? Conceived by filmmaker J.J. Abrams and written by acclaimed novelist Doug Dorst, Ship of Theseus is the central novel within the experience that is S., a multi-faceted narrative of love and mystery. Ship of Theseus is at its core and is the final book written by a man shrouded in deception and violence.

 It tells the mystical adventure of an equally mysterious figure, who is struggling to discover his own identity. Abducted onto the eponymous ship, the main character is swept into a story that spans oceans and ports, mountains and caves, capitals and citadels. Two things sustain him: his lifelong search for his love, Sola; and the infernal purpose of the ship and its crew. Equal parts Kafka and Lovecraft, Ship of Theseus is both a frightening adventure and a philosophical treasure hunt."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/V.m.

 Living alone in the kingdom of Atal, former tech student Justin must explore his new home on his own and decide who&#x27;s worthy of learning the kind of magic that comes so easily to him. In a land where magic equals power, the choice of who can be trusted to use mana productively is now his to make, a responsibility he doesn&#x27;t take lightly.

 Secretly, Justin (now known as Elian) is still learning the finer points of the manipulation of mana. As he experiments with the creation of coveted Earth items, even those that have little meaning in this place—iron, for example—he&#x27;s called upon to make something his people truly need: weapons. And when the time comes, he&#x27;ll pour himself into the creation of a weapon that could save lives, including his own, in a battle that will shake the foundations of his new world.

 Polishing the skills he&#x27;s learned and determining what might be beneficial to introduce to some trusted others, Justin grows into a man with his own credo and rapid-fire use of mana. A teacher and a valued asset in the expansion of the kingdom, he&#x27;ll face unthinkable obstacles and heart-breaking betrayals before the fierce, unexpected clash that will call on every one of his skills before the last man has fallen.

 Heading home after a long day of classes, tech student Justin takes a little-used path through the woods. But when he stumbles unexpectedly, he rolls downhill and into the challenge of a lifetime. Faced with exotic, glowing plants he&#x27;s never seen before and a luminescent pool of crystal-blue water that exerts a frightening pull over him, he&#x27;s literally reborn in a rough, raw landscape—in a time before history began . . .

 Reduced to a helpless child but somehow retaining his adult memories, Elian—as he&#x27;s now known—must come to know the family that has claimed him, all the while learning a strange new language and the culture of this foreign land, where he must survive until he can attempt to return home. But most importantly, he must master the light that surrounds him, an exhilarating magic called mana that will shape his future, if he&#x27;ll only grow up.

 Through concentrated apprenticeship and some calamitous mistakes, Elian will finally become a young man again. And just in time to help his people face a dangerous force that threatens their small kingdom.

 Alana wasn’t always a child of the Kingdom of Bergond. In fact, she hails from an entirely different world. But an accident on Earth left her dead, and she was reincarnated as the daughter of a farmer and his wife in the hamlet of Orsken. Now, she’s learning how to live in a land vastly unlike that which she came from—and how to wield the new powers she possesses. For, even by the rules of her strange new home, Alana is special: a young bard capable of mending wounds, counteracting poisons, and healing the sick, all through the use of mana and her own mind.

 But as she cultivates her newfound abilities through training with various teachers in the magical arts, those around her are struggling. War has torn the empire apart, and famine is disrupting the simple lives of the villagers. When the conflict comes right to their doorstep, Alana is separated from her family and forced to set out on her own. To remain safe and have any chance of reuniting with those she loves, she will need to apply all her cunning, sorcery, and knowledge—both of this world and Earth. Because there are forces that would do anything to control her, and they’re growing ever closer to discovering who and where she is.

 Blending elements of traditional and progression fantasy, Melody of Mana is an action-packed and original story of magic, politics, friendship, and intrigue from a thrilling new voice in the genre.

 Alana has not had an easy second life. Ever since she was reborn in the Kingdom of Bergond after meeting her untimely demise on Earth, she’s struggled—first, as the poor daughter of a peasant farmer; next, as an orphan on the run from the war; then, as a formidable novice mage with skills well beyond most of those her age. Now, she’s facing a challenge unlike any she’s had to confront in this world before: school.

 Within the hallowed halls of the Bergond Academy of Mages, Alana must contend with an entirely new set of political and personal struggles—from understanding the mores of dealing with wealthy nobles to hiring a maid to help with her daily duties to navigating (for a second time) adolescent flirtations, romances, friendships, and puberty.

 And as if that weren’t enough, as Alana’s skill in spellcasting, magical-item creation, and combat grows, it becomes clear to her professors that she’s no ordinary student. Alana must figure out how to keep her past life a secret while using her otherworldly knowledge to the best of her ability. Because war is looming ever closer—and not all the students at the academy will make it out unscathed.

 Filled with twisty political intrigue, clever world-building, and unforgettable characters, Melody of Mana 2 is a brilliant mix of isekai fantasy and dark academia tropes.

 Ever since Alana was reborn in the Kingdom of Bergond, her life has been a series of adventures and surprises. But waking up to discover the kingdom has been conquered, her school has been destroyed, and her parents are back in her life might be the biggest shock yet.

 Now that Lord Durin is in charge, everything’s more complicated. For one thing, Alana’s father is Durin’s right-hand man, which means the teen must contend with courtly manners, stuffy traditions, and noble obligations, though she’d rather be practicing how to create portals and fight monsters. For another, Durin’s rule is still tenuous, leaving him and all who support him open to attack. And as if that weren’t enough, Alana must find time to protect her friends, salvage her relationship, and keep up with her studies enough to actually graduate.

 Brilliantly combining traditional and progression fantasy with elements of romance, humor, dark academia, and action-adventure, Melody of Mana 3 is an irresistible addition to any genre fan’s collection.

 It&#x27;s been almost two decades since Alana woke up from an accident on Earth to find herself transported into the body of a child in the kingdom of Bergond. In that time, she&#x27;s faced war and famine, deadly political plots and dull courtly traditions, magical mayhem and romantic entanglements, and she&#x27;s thrived through it all. Newly graduated from magic school, she&#x27;s ready for her next adventure: a quest to uncover long-buried secrets that will take her far from the city of Lithere and deep into the kingdom of the elves.

 Only, Alana&#x27;s long voyage isn&#x27;t without its own set of complications. Between an encounter with a hurricane whale, a run-in with goblins, and less-than-friendly greetings upon reaching her destination, Alana&#x27;s cunning and spellcasting prowess are taxed from the moment she steps on the ship to leave her homeland. But none of those trials compare to what she will find when she lands in Atali: an ancient power that could forever transform Bergond—and a startling connection to a life Alana thought she&#x27;d all but left behind . . .

 With swashbuckling action on the high seas as well as the blend of politics, friendship, and intrigue that has defined the series thus far, Melody of Mana 4 is a must-hear chapter in this irresistible progressive fantasy.

Most recently, she&#x27;s been commissioned by Emperor Durin to set up a magical portal that will connect the capital city of Ermath to the far northern reaches of his domain in Linden. Only, the journey to Linden is plagued from the outset. It seems someone knows about the mission and will do whatever it takes to prevent its completion.

 As if that weren&#x27;t enough, Alana&#x27;s Earthly past seems determined to catch up with her—with potentially catastrophic consequences. Now, she&#x27;ll have to untangle a tricky conundrum of time and space to get the gates operational, all the while contending with shadowy threats to her safety as well as dangerous rumors that could expose her otherworldly origins.

 “To survive in this galaxy, you need a wand in one hand and a gun in the other.”

 On a little-known planet, Archmage Varic Vallenar casts a grand spell to empower himself with the magical abilities of his alternate selves. The ritual works too well, granting Varic not only the magic but also the memories from six lives.

 Including their gruesome deaths.

 Now, Varic has power greater than any wizard in galactic history, but he knows that won’t be enough. The enemies he faced in those alternate lives were apocalyptic in scale. Terrors of technology and magic. Nothing that he, or anyone, can defeat.

 Sun-eating extra-dimensional insects, shadowy secret organizations, genetically enhanced alien super-soldiers, ruthless megacorporations, and hordes of cyborg undead all lurk in the darkest corners of the galaxy, and Varic knows that any of them can become a world-ending threat at any moment.

 All these are beyond any wizard, no matter how many spells he’s mastered or how many interstellar warships he’s rallied to his cause. Hopeless, Varic finds himself trying to preserve what little he can from the coming doom.

 Until he hears rumors of a mythical starship, an invincible vessel of heroes made to do battle against galactic threats.

 A ship called The Last Horizon.

 The battle with the Iron Legion has left The Last Horizon battered and broken, drifting in space. Varic needs an exceptional engineer to fix his ship, and there’s only one person for the job: Mell, the master Aether technician.

 But first, they have to break her out of prison.

 Mell has been captured by the Advocates, a group of superpowered vigilantes who dominate their corner of the galaxy. They are led by Starhammer, an invincible champion with a personal obsession with Mell.

 The Last Horizon may be crewed by the greatest heroes in the galaxy, but even they have to be careful with Starhammer. Every time he survives a battle, he grows stronger.

 In another life, Varic saw the end of that road. If he lets Starhammer become too powerful, the galaxy is doomed.

 The Last Horizon has already sown new legends across the galaxy, tales of monsters defeated and worlds saved. For better and for worse, their reputation is spreading.

 Their enemies have taken notice.

 On Karosha, the Perfected gather fleets crewed by inhumanly flawless soldiers. In the Galactic Union, the secretive organization known as Solstice pulls strings in the shadows. And in the depths of Dark Space, after years of silence, the ravenous D’Niss begin to stir.

 Raion Raithe, Knight of The Last Horizon, sees these threats as a chance to redeem himself. He will stand against the danger, and he will stand strong, no matter what it costs.

 His friends are counting on him.

It had its ups and downs, much like anyone else’s. Being a talented martial artist had definitely been an up, while high school as a whole was a down. His own father was not a great role model, and his uncle was everything he wanted to be.

 To Ash, it felt like a very normal life. Right up until he was literally pulled into a portal that spat him out into another world. One that was full of martial arts. And martial artists who could use magic. To set the very air on fire with a punch or to turn their skin hard as diamonds. To fly through the air, if they had enough power. A world where the strong ruled and the weak died.

 Three years of living his life as one of the citizens, those without power, and Ash has figured out how to survive with his adoptive family and a lot of persistence. His goals in life have become to give back to those who gave to him. And he’d do whatever he had to to do that.

 Except Ash is about to get his life turned around again. Turned around and altered completely. He’s about to discover a treasure from a time long lost. Forgotten. A treasure that is going to change his destiny and give him another direction to go. If he wants it.

 A cultivator.

 He’d become the Count of Dungeon, made a hostage, married off to the false queen’s daughter against his will, and had his county made ground zero for a religious war.

 To top all that off, the Dark Lord of the North wants to see Ryker personally.

 The smoldering ruins of Dungeon have been cleared, the patterns reset, and Ryker has a task that is more than likely too much for him.

 Hold Dungeon, and give Lauren, the rightful queen, some breathing room.

 Take the queendom back, destroy two armies, and give Lauren, the rightful queen, back her crown.

 It isn’t as if they didn’t deserve it either.

 They had driven him from his home. Chased him physically from the very guild house itself. All the way to the gates of the city.

 Simply because he wasn’t as strong as they expected him to be.

 As strong as he’d expected himself to be.

 He’d returned to the city the next day and left with his means for revenge. Something he’d hidden away and told no one about when he found it in one of his few Dungeon Dives.

 An inactive Dungeon Core.

 A crystal the size of a fist with a soul inside. One that could create anything from mana it wanted to. From monsters and complex cave systems to gold coins.

 Years spent in planning, and unfortunately farming, as he waited. Now it felt like his moment was finally here.

 The Dungeon Core had been acting strange lately. As if it were finally… coming to life.

 Watching over the crystal like a hawk for this very event, Ryker impatiently waits. Any day now, it&#x27;d start.

 And he could set about taking his vengeance.

 Starting with ripping the soul of the dungeon out.

 Rene has become the Hood, the Mask, and young Anatolis all in one.

 Where he continues to take more power with the Anatolis bankroll, his blade, or someone else’s blood.

 Except as he gains more power, he becomes more of a target.

 With every day, more people are targeting one of his lives and what they can take from him.

 The city is about to be pitched head-first into the front lines of more than one fight to the death.

 It has no idea, and it’s one true defender is a serial-killer turned hitman who became a bounty-hunting money-lender that moonlights as a gang leader.

 A day that his career as a hitman for hire built on the monster’s needs will end. Where Rene will be forced to atone for his actions. To be held accountable and judged.

 Except the verdict has already long since passed and needs no deliberation.

 His sentence was being sent hundreds of years into the past, into a different world, even, where he must live a life for the betterment of others. Every action judged as it happens and weighed out against him.

 But even this new idyllic life he’s been living for 18 years is now completely off the rails, and Rene has gone back into a life lived in the underworld.

 Armed with a few gifts granted to him by the one who judged him, gifts better suited to a fantasy about living in a video game, Rene has to maneuver his way through all the twists and turns in his new life while using all the things he’d learned in his old one.

 Except using those skills is a double-edged sword. If he’s not careful, he’ll end up right back where he started. Or so he would hope.

 War is on the horizon and Felicie is in the crosshairs.

 Or more accurately, the Mask is."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/William D. Arand/Monster&#x27;s Mercy- Book 3.jpg" alt="Cover of Monster&#x27;s Mercy: Book 3" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Monster&#x27;s Mercy: Book 3</span></div>

 He got up, went to work, forced people to balance their scales—either through taking lives or forced penance—went home, spent time with his daughter, slept with one of his girlfriends, and went to sleep.

 Only to repeat the pattern over and over and over.

 Life was the furthest thing from mundane that it could ever be.

 Warner’s life had changed when his daughter had been nearly fatally injured, plunging Warner into a world of paranormal creatures, monsters, and magic that he’d never known existed.

 Then he came out the other side as the arbiter of Retribution. He now personally hands out justice to any and all he comes across.

 Warner has been using his powers considerably since then. Cutting down all who would stand before him and attempt to stop him in his personal crusade.

 The price he had to pay for such a power cost him his life. He was forced to the point of giving all of himself to redeem the original holder of the right of Retribution, Warin.

 Warner was quick to pay that price.

 His effort was paid back to him in triplicate when Warin willingly passed the mantle to him. Giving all of what he was to Warner, effectively ending his life.

 Now Warner is the holder of the rights for Vengeance, Retribution, and Redemption.

 Each power has recognized him and responds willingly, allowing him to blend all three of them with growing mastery.

 Long gone are the days of being sick after utilizing them.

 Now the only concern Warner faces is the correct usage of those powers and when to use them.

 The world is an ever-shifting gray area that gets murkier by the year.

 The great change that’d been on the horizon is now upon the world. A change that will cast the entirety of existence into shadow or bring it back to stability.

 A reckoning no one wished for has arrived.

 The very world stands on the edge of a knife, waiting to see who will prevail."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/William D.

 Each time he finds himself throwing up golden vomit that turns to blood, he has to wonder just how much damage he is causing to his own body.

 Except a great change in the world is coming. One that will force a reckoning no one wishes, with Warner becoming a massive lightning rod for it.

 Life was as mundane as anyone could ever fear it to be.

 Today was the day that all that would change.

 On this day, his daughter Maya would be nearly fatally injured, plunging Warner into a world of paranormal creatures, monsters, and magic he’d never known existed.

 The only consolation is that he discovers he’s not quite human, either.

 Nor is he very happy with the way of the world or how it spun. Built on corruption, lies, and injustice for all.

 An unlikely answer comes to him that fits his wounded heart.

 Justice handed out by him personally. Vengeance and retribution in equal measure to all that deserve it.

 Using his newfound powers and unbending determination, Warner is going to carve a path through the world that’ll send the darkest corners of existence fleeing before him. Even as he crushes them beneath his furious strikes.

 The very world will tremble with his actions and fear his coming.

 If you haven’t, then maybe you’re not the type of person to work for a global corporation.

 Edmund, however, is just such an individual.

 He works for Legion: a corporation of unimaginable reach that he barely understands, a corporation that seems determined to put itself smack dab in the middle of a brewing civil war between Super Heroes and Super Villains.

 That doesn’t even take into account the fact that the governments of the world don’t seem to be taking too keenly to Legion, either.

 All of that is mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He works for the company and does all he can to make sure they succeed.

 From cleaning up after a bad operation and disposing of bodies to providing hush money, getting rid of agents from opposing intelligence communities, or just helping an informant escape from a Super Villain, Edmund has done it all in this line of work.

 That doesn’t fill up the entirety of his life, however.

 The rest of it is trying to get a date with the woman he likes and looking out for his little sister while hiding the fact he himself has a superpower.

 A superpower that lets him save and load the world whenever he likes as if it were a video game and subject to his personal whims.

 At least, that’s what he thought in the beginning."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/William D. Arand/Save State Hero - Save State Hero, Book 1.jpg" alt="Cover of Save State Hero - Save State Hero, Book 1" loading="lazy" /></button><span>Save State Hero - Save State Hero, Book 1</span></div>

 Edmund, however, is just such an individual. He had worked for Legion and his mentor and savior, Felix Campbell.

 Now, though, Edmund is swapping employers. Moving from the only home he had known and the few people he truly cared for to working for Dorothy after she swaps sides. Which essentially means Edmund will soon be working for a Super Villain, who in turn works for an Evil God. A lot like a global corporation, once again.

 All of that is mostly irrelevant to Edmund, though. He&#x27;ll work and do all he can to make sure they succeed. Because all of this is to get a better result than the previous one, which, while it was a good ending, wasn&#x27;t the best ending. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect route clear.

 Now, Edmund is reloading his Save-States to get back into it and test out something he could never actually handle when he played video games—the Bad Route.

 Working for the Evil version of Dorothy and Zeus while attempting to crush everyone else, all while trying to figure out how he can help his little sister.

 Because Edmund is rather comfortable with his superpower now, as well as the fact that he&#x27;s now quite aware that he&#x27;s the only one who can do it.

 At least, that&#x27;s what he thought when he started the Bad Route."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/William D.

 At least, that was until Felix leveraged a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give himself a great deal of points. Investing in Super Heroes and Super Villains and owning them. Using them, Felix built up an empire: an organization by the name of Legion.

 It grew to heights that could stand toe-to-toe with governments, even at a military level. Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed despite becoming a mega-company CEO.

 Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime. Governments still wanted to take everything from Felix and Legion. In the end, Legion had to back down. Retreat back to a new homeworld, losing important people in the process.

 Kit Carrington and Lillian Lux sacrificed themselves to save him and were marooned on a hostile planet. Even as their home world fell into ruin, Felix fell back. He resolved himself to wait for a chance to get back into the fight after tending to his wounded organization.

 Now, the Overgod Runner has just appeared and offered him a second chance to rebuild Legion and crush everyone in his way. If he could do that, and take over the government of the country he’s about to be dropped into, he’ll get Kit and Lily back.

 There was no way Felix would let go of this chance, nor could he even consider the possibility of failure.

 The foundation for all his plans is now in place. The time has come to branch out into becoming a global power—a power that governments can&#x27;t touch, nor would they willingly want to.

 It&#x27;s time to push Legion right into the forefront of everyone&#x27;s mind without them ever realizing what they are looking at. Legion will operate from the sidelines while controlling everyone.

 Fighting against Zeus with the Overgod and the Architect, finishing his business with the Guild of Heroes and League of Villains, pushing the Association and the Legion to the pinnacle of power. All those things were on his to-do list, but to Felix there was only one real answer.

 Worrying about the longevity of his company, Felix begins to expand into other cities. So they’ve packed up the car, put in all the requisite forms, gotten the approvals, and set out to start Legion up in a new city.

 Ever since he and the Legion had been forced to flee their headquarters four years previous, nothing had gone quite right. In fact, Felix and the Legion have been locked in a shadow war with enemies unknown. Ones with magic that could carve through their technology easily.

 As the rest of the world fell apart, tearing itself to pieces at every turn with the return of the old gods, the Legion has held the chaos back. The price in blood has been climbing slowly, lately.

 Felix suspects there’s a change on the horizon. One that he hasn’t prepared or developed a plan for. Or so his paranoia has been telling him. That there’s a change coming now that’ll shake up the world. One that will turn it inside out, Legion and Felix along with it.

 Felix has decided it’s time to push ahead and act. To finish things and protect his people at the same time. To take his Legion and make it safe.

 Because that’s all that matters in the end to him. His Legion. And it always came first.

 He has the ability to modify any item he owns. To upgrade anything.

 Sounds great on paper. Almost like a video game.

 Except that the amount of power it takes to actually change, modify, or upgrade anything worthwhile is beyond his abilities.

 With that in mind, Felix settled into a normal life. A normal job.

 His entire world changes when the city he lives in is taken over by a super villain. Becoming a country of one city. A city state.

 Surprisingly, not a whole lot changed. Politicians were still corrupt. Banks still held onto your money. And criminals still committed crime.

 Though the black market has become more readily available.

 And in that not-so-black market, Felix discovers he has a way to make his power useful after all, and grasps a hold of his chance with both hands.

Gus’s life had been a tedium and boredom he’d grown comfortable with. One that he sought out after he’d come back from his tour of duty.

 That was before Melody, a contractor, more or less blew his life up as if it were a building packed full of C-4. Then she pranced around the ashes of it like it was the end of the world and was conjuring up the end times herself. All while breaking in a rookie by the name of Vanessa into the PID. A gung-ho and eager young detective looking to prove herself. Then commandeering and recruiting a cleaning lady who turned out to be an elven dryad sorceress who viewed killing people as little more than emptying the trash can.

 Gus had lived through it, though. Made it work for him and had come out of it without too many new scars. An adventure that he hadn’t wanted any part of...that involved the Fed being blown up, a stadium full of Paras all going into a feral rage, and breaking off a plot hatched by what felt like an organization that rivaled the Fed.

 Which apparently was all in a day’s work, right up until they fired you for doing that work because you made the brass look bad.

 Without a job, more people relying on him than ever, and no direction, Gus is going to have to put on his big boy pants and figure something out. And soon.

 It’s a good thing that he’s a boogieman. Because, being an apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him was something he could fall back on. He could lean into it and make it work for him.

 He’d done it before when he was in the military. Made a name for himself out there in the bloody desert. He was &quot;The Hunter&quot;. A name that the elven mothers now used to instill fear into misbehaving children. A name that grown men and women wouldn’t discuss in polite company. Except, despite Gus’s best intentions to get back to his stable nonlife, he’s going to get thrown right back into the fray. Whether he likes it or not, he’s about to be handed a new problem that’s going to mess up what little remained of his life.

 Unfortunately, his past was going to catch up to him and meet up with his future.

 Gus’ life had been a tedium and boredom he’d grown comfortable with. One that he sought out after he’d come back from his tour of duty.

 That was before Melody, a contractor, more or less blew his life up as if it were a building packed full of C-4.

 Then helped him make a new life, which he himself ended blowing up.

 A cushy new job with the FED, thrown out the window with a single gunshot.

 All based on an assumption of who was working for who, and that he’d been on the wrong side of the equation.

 And so ended his career in law enforcement after he became the assassin of a presidential candidate.

 Now Gus is on to the next job - this time, working for his contractor and wife. The job they’re about to be given is a high-paying one.

 The thing is, that the people they’re going up against? They’re just out to see the world burn. To send it screaming back down into the dark ages.

 It’s a good thing that he’s a Boogieman.

 Because being an apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him was something he could fall back on even in this situation. To hunt, investigate, and watch from the shadows.

 Wouldn’t be the first time he’d put his life on the line, either.

 Unfortunately, for everyone involved, the long forgotten and primordial past was rearing its ugly head.

 Gus knows he can certainly punch above his own weight class, but this case might just be the one that ends him.

 A detective in the paranormal investigations department. A job he could work day in and day out in relative peace. One cold and forgotten cup of coffee at a time.

 An apex predator that made the entirety of the paranormal world fear him. His very species was often killed as soon as they were found out.

 By government and citizen alike.

 He’s a Boogieman.

 A name that made humans laugh, and vampires curse. It was a strange life to be sure.

 To live his life to the best of his abilities, gain experience, level up, and strive to enjoy himself as best he could in a backwater. Which, while tough on its own, was made infinitely harder by his father being the local executioner.

 All of that becomes infinitely worse when his entire family is murdered.

 Dominic is then thrust into a war between noble houses that had been put on hold for generations. A war that the royal family lost, and now only had one true heir and claimant: Dominic Randolph.

 Now, a voice that&#x27;s supposedly a Dragon, who happens to be an ancestor, is talking to him. Dominic can have four classes at the same time, which is impossible, and his max levels have skyrocketed to heights unknown.

 These are just the first of his royal gifts to be taken back even as the country descends into chaos as the Randolph family returns.

 Armed with a new name, his father&#x27;s axe, a map leading him to a Dungeon, and whatever he could stuff in a backpack, Domnic&#x27;s adventure begins."><img class="cover-inline" src="covers/William D.

 In a world of creatures that went bump in the night, few fought for humanity. Fewer still put humanity first. Fighting with sword, blade, or word, their numbers were insufficient.

 Those who did did so from places and situations that the world didn&#x27;t appreciate or condone. That they&#x27;d actively disavow and ignore.

 Unfortunately, for those who fought such a battle, those who stared into the abyss long enough, it most certainly did indeed stare back. Stare back and set roots deep within.

 Jeremiah is about to experience when even the abyss is revealed to be nothing at all, and discovers his own truth.

 Having evolved to C-grade successfully, Jake is ready to enter the most well-known World Wonder in the entire multiverse to get some sweet levels under his belt. However, Nevermore is far more than just an immense dungeon to power up in.

 It’s a competition where newly evolved C-grades compete on Leaderboards to prove themselves in front of the entire multiverse. Geniuses from every universe and faction appear, all of them vying for the top spot and to prove themselves the very best, like no one ever was.

 Faced with tough competition, Jake gleefully takes on the challenge. With four competent comrades at his side, they face floor after floor as he dives deeper and deeper into the depths of Nevermore, encountering new situations, horrible water levels, powerful monsters, Challenge Dungeons, and perhaps even the occasional labyrinth with an overly invested creator.

 Many years and even more levels have passed since Jake and friends entered Nevermore. With quite a number of floors passed, they turn their attention to the Challenge Dungeons.

 These Challenge Dungeons offer – as the name suggests – unique challenges and circumstances, and completing them will earn each Nevermore competitor points and multipliers to their existing points. As things unfold, it quickly becomes clear it’s through these dungeons that the true top-scorer of the Nevermore Leaderboards will be found.

 Jake has no plans on losing out to anyone, especially not his fellow Chosen, Ell’Hakan.

 Follow Jake as he takes on these five dungeons, facing unique challenges, environments, scenarios, and opponents, with perhaps even a few truly worthwhile duels sprinkled in there.

 The Nevermore Leaderboards competition has gathered more attention than perhaps in any era prior, with gods getting both directly and indirectly involved to see who will eventually come out on top.

 Jake, who has so far been performing above all expectations, enters his final Challenge Dungeon before it’s time to meet up with his party once more. Together, they’ll make a final push to try and climb as many floors as possible before time is up and, hopefully, in the end, find their names atop the Nevermore Leaderboards.

 However, the competition is tough. Jake and his party aren’t the only ones performing far above expectations. Ell’Hakan, the self-proclaimed rival of Jake, has set himself up to rival or even shatter all records prior, aiming for the top spot himself.

 In the end, who will prove themselves the top C-grade of their generation?

 And, perhaps more importantly to Jake, will there be a forced after-party following the Leaderboards reveal?

 With a huge open planet before him, Jake has literally grown wings as he begins his conquest of the local wildlife. With his newfound freedom, he finds his true Path as a hunter. All the while trying to avoid the responsibilities of having founded the first city on the planet. Oh, and bird friends.

 Meanwhile, all across Earth, Pylons of Civilization are claimed. Cities are constructed, humanity beginning to regain its foothold. Factions grow and expand as political alliances are formed and professional relations are created, as godly and mortal factions alike move to establish themselves as the dominant force on Earth.

 None of which Jake cares too much about while he finds himself far too busy doing what is truly important in life:

 Hunting, alchemy, and getting that D-grade evolution.

 Yalsten, an old cursed land once occupied by ancient vampires, but now long forgotten, finds itself the grounds for the system event known as a Treasure Hunt.

 Follow Jake as he and the rest of his fellow Earthlings compete and cooperate in uncovering the secrets of this ancient land while naturally acquiring any and all of that sweet, sweet loot. But not without trouble.

 The ancient defenses still stand between Jake and his rightful bounty, the cursed land itself rising in opposition against the invaders. Vampires of old who have long been dormant are awakened from their slumber, with each one appearing only stronger than the one before. By that logic, Jake truly hoped for a proper final boss of this event; the only question was....

 Would he find the ultimate challenge from the vampires or his fellow man?

 But first, Jake has a family to visit, and an auction to attend. Then, it’s time to face the challenges the planet has to offer, and by using the many rewards from the treasure hunt, Jake aims to improve his repertoire while getting some more levels under his belt.

 And what could be a better idea than invading a massive termite hive to craft a new weapon using the extremely powerful curse of resentment from an ancient vampire land? Yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong with that. Ancient curses are well-known for being harmless, after all.

 Assuming all goes well–which it surely will–Jake has one more challenge he must face. Perhaps his most dangerous one yet.

 That’s right, it’s back-to-school season.

 School in this case being an ancient Order worshipping a Primordial snake god.

Between hiding his identity as the Chosen of the Big Boss, being forced to attend get-togethers, visiting vampires to sell ancient memorabilia, and trying to actually learn some alchemy, Jake&#x27;s busier than ever.

 Earth also still calls. There, he helps friends deal with family issues by going on a nice road trip with Carmen and Sylphie. On the way, he can hopefully find time to hunt down the final Primas he needs—powerful monsters with unique key fragments—to participate in the upcoming system event dubbed the Seat of the Exalted Prima.

 An event that hopefully—no, certainly—won’t have any unforeseen Bloodline-induced shenanigans.

 Definitely not.

 Out of nowhere, Jake gets his alchemy training interrupted as he is forced back to the first universe to deal with a sudden emergency. Earth has been invaded by another Chosen with plans that do not include a fair fight, assisted by natives unsatisfied with the status quo.

 The feeble political balance on Earth is shattered as factions take advantage of the sudden turmoil to exercise the wills of their gods. War breaks out, and every force finds themselves implicated one way or another.

 On his way to face the enemy Chosen, Jake explores parts of Earth he has never seen before, makes new allies, gets to know more of the Malefic Viper’s most treasured secrets through incredibly invasive visions of the past, improves his abilities, and gets plenty of those sweet, sweet levels.

 But before all that… it’s time to dispense justice upon the most evil beings in all of existence: Mushroom Men.

 A final push that includes refining one last skill before he evolves. Once that’s done, all he needs is a few more levels and to finish off his bucket list of vanities before it’s time to evolve.

 The evolution itself will have no surprises, right?

 Jake will no doubt learn more about himself in his quest to explore his own abilities, and of course some things don’t go entirely as expected…but little does Jake know just how much his happy little accidents can send tremors through the multiverse and the impact it can have.

 Who knows, maybe the waves are big enough that it’s time to finally have a proper Chosen Ceremony, officially embracing his title as the Chosen of the Malefic Viper.
